# OLF conversion request
myViewBoard offers a **File Conversion Request** service for educators who have accumulated whiteboard files from multiple platforms over the years. This service converts supported third-party whiteboard formats into OLF to ensure compatibility with the myViewBoard apps.
  

  

## Supported formats
The following formats are supported:
  * Flipchart (used by Promethean ActivInspire)
  * Notebook (used by SMART Notebook)
  * ENB (used by ViewBoard 2.1 and EasiNote3)


  

  

## Access the File Conversion Request page
To upload your files for conversion, follow the steps below:
  

  1. Launch your browser and open the following site:  
  
  
  

  2. Sign in with your ViewSonic account.   
The ViewSonic dashboard appears.  
  

  3. Go to the **myViewBoard** tile: 
    1. Click the ellipsis to show the menu.
    2. Click **myViewBoard settings**.   
The myViewBoard Settings page should open.  
  

  4. Click **File Conversion** on the left panel.
  5. Click **Upload** to add the file you want to convert.


  

Conversion will take some time to complete. The service sends an email notification once the process is done. 
  

  

  

## Misc info
Keep the following in mind when using the service:
  

  * Maximum uploads permitted: Up to 10 files
  * Maximum upload file size: 100MB
  * An email notification will be sent upon completion.
  * Flash and animation components cannot be converted.
  * myViewBoard does not guarantee that the conversion will be an identical recreation of the original.


  

  

Note that the latest myViewBoard supports directly opening the following file types created on older versions of myViewBoard with no conversion required:
  

  * `vBoard` files, created by legacy myViewBoard for Windows 
  * `IWB` files, created by legacy myViewBoard for Android


  

Afterwards, users can save these files in the OLF format. The OLF format was created to establish a common standard usable on both the Windows and Android versions of myViewBoard. For more information about the OLF format, refer to the article below:
