# Subscription and Plan Management
For a full details of how our pricing and plan works, please visit our 
  
The **Plan Management** page in **ClassSwift Hub (Admin View)** allows administrators to view, manage, and upgrade their organization’s subscription plan.  
From this page, admins can monitor plan usage, expiry dates, seat assignments, and available upgrade options.
**Overview**
Plan Management helps organization administrators keep track of their **ClassSwift plan** , **user allocation** , and **renewal schedule**.  
Admins can also compare available plan types for both **Individual** and **Entity (School/Organization)** accounts.
**Plan Information**
At the top of the page, you’ll find a summary of your organization’s active plan details:
  * **Plan Name** – Displays the current subscription (e.g., __Schools & Districts__).
  * **Expiry Date** – Shows when the plan will expire.
  * **Assigned Users / Available Seats** – Indicates how many licenses are in use versus total seats.
  * **Talk to an Expert** – Opens a support channel to contact a ViewSonic representative for plan advice or upgrades.


**Tabs in Plan Management**
There are two main tabs under the summary section:
  1. **Online User** – Displays currently active teachers on the system.
  2. **Purchase History** – Shows past subscription transactions and renewal records.


**Plan Comparison Section**
Below the summary, you can view plan options available for both **Individual** and **Entity** users.

**Switching or Upgrading Plans**
  * Click **Switch to this plan** under the desired plan card to change your subscription.
  * If upgrading from an __Individual__ to an __Entity__ plan, contact ViewSonic Support through **Talk to an Expert**.
  * Plan changes may affect the number of available seats or billing cycle dates.


**Tips**
  * Always verify your seat allocation before adding new teachers.
  * Use the **Purchase History** tab to confirm renewal status and payment confirmations.
  * If your plan is nearing expiry, upgrade or renew early to avoid access interruptions.
