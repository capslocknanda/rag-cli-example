# Board history
The **Board history** feature allows users to track updates on the board and restore previous versions. Note that Board history is not available on mobile devices.
  

  

## Access board history
To access **Board history** , perform the following steps:
  

  1. Click the **Settings** icon.
  2. Select **Board History**.
  3. The **Action** tab is displayed by default. 
  4. Click the **Versions** tab to switch.


  

  

  

## Actions
The **Actions** tab displays all modifications to the board and details the changes with the date they were made. The **Actions** tab is available only for users assigned with the Admins, Members and Contributors roles.
  

Entries are grouped by date, and are available for **45 days**. Use the following icons to manage the entries on this tab:
  

  * Click 
  * Click **Expand all** or **Collapse all** to open/close all sections at the same time.
  * Click 


  

  

  

## Versions

The Versions tab is available only for users assigned with the Admin and Member user roles. Note that the Versions tab is not available on Microsoft Teams.
  

  

[Delete](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/teamone-board-tools/teamone-board-history)
WHEN RESTORING A SAVED VERSION
When you restore a version of your board, TeamOne creates a separate **duplicate copy of the original**. If you wish to continue working on this restored version, **share this duplicate with collaborators** who also had access to the original board.
  

  

### Manually saved versions 
TeamOne allows users to manually save a board at any time. Each board can have up to **10 manually saved versions**. To manually save a version of the board, perform the following steps:
  

  1. Open the **Board history** panel. 
  2. Click the **Manually saved versions** label.  
  

  3. In the **Add to version history** window:
    1. Edit or leave the default **Version title** as is.
    2. (Optional) Add a description for the saved board.  
  

  4. Click **Add** to create a manual save.


  

  

  

  

Saving the board adds a new entry with the following options:
  * **Restore version**. Reverts the board to the state when it was saved.
  * **Edit**. Update the contents of the version title and description.
  * **Delete**. Remove the saved version.


  

  

  

  

### Autosaved versions

  1. Open the **Board history** panel.
  2. Go to the **Actions** tab 
  3. Look under the **Autosaved versions** section.
  4. To restore a previous version of the board, click the
