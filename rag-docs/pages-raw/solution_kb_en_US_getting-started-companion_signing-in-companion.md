**HOST NAME AND PARTICIPANT SIGN-IN**

### Join as guest
If you don’t have a myViewBoard account and still want to use Companion for work collaboration, then type in the [**Host name**](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/classroom-engagement/share-whiteboard-session#invite-students-0) and **Your name** in the given fields.
Alternatively, use the Companion App to scan the **QR code** of the Whiteboard session you want to join. Once signed in, you will be able to use the **Companion App** as a remote control for your Whiteboard for Windows, Android, and iOS sessions.
Guest sign-in with Host name filled in using QR code.
### Session password when joining
When the [Whiteboard session host has set a session password](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/account-settings/followme-settings#set-a-session-password-2), whether the Companion user is signing in as a participant or guest, they will have to input this session password.
In such cases, the [host should share their session password from within myViewBoard Whiteboard](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/classroom-engagement/share-whiteboard-session#inviting-when-session-password-is-enabled-2), and the Companion user will be asked to input this password along with the host name.

If you have signed in as a host/IT admin, no session password is required. However, if you wish to interact with the Whiteboard session and you _are not_ _the host of the Whiteboard session_ , a session password will be required. Learn more about [joining through Magic Box features](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/companion-and-whiteboard/join-whiteboard-session#join-through-magic-box-features-1).
If you _have signed in with the same account as you did as the myViewBoard Whiteboard host_ , you will not be asked for a session password.
