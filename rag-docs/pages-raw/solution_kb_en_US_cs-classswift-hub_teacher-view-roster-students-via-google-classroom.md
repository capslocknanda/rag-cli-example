# Teacher View: Roster Students via Google Classroom
This guide explains how to roster students via Google Classroom.
**Step 1. Import Classes and Student Rosters to ClassSwift**
  1. Log in to **ClassSwift Hub** and go to **My Class**.


2. Click the **Google Classroom** button on the top right.
3. Select the account that should be synced with Google Classroom.
4. Grant ClassSwift access to your Google account. __(This is a one-time process.)__
5. Select the classes you want to import and click **Import**.
6. Check the import status:
  * During the process, the **Last Import Time** will display **IMPORTING**.
  * Once completed, the status will automatically change to **IMPORTED**.
  * Your classes have now been successfully imported. The imported classes will appear in **My Class** with a Google Classroom icon.


_Reminder:_
_Once you choose an account, it cannot be changed. If you need to switch accounts, please contact our customer support._
_If you are using**Google Workspace for Education (edu.email)** and your students are under the age of 18, you may need your IT administrator’s approval for ClassSwift as a third-party app._
_If you or your students see an error message indicating that access to ClassSwift is blocked (for example, when connecting your Google account, importing classes, or logging into ClassSwift), please check with your school IT administrator._
## **Step 2. Invite Students to Join the Class**
### **Option 1: Post on Google Classroom**
  * Click the three dots on the top right of the class you want students to join.
  * Select **Post on Google Classroom**.


  * A default announcement with the class link will appear. Click **Post** to publish it to students’ Google Classroom.


### **Option 2: Copy and Share Class Link**
Click the three dots on the top right of the class you want students to join.
Select **Copy Link**.
  * Share the link through any platform you use to communicate with your students.


## Step 3. Refresh Class Data from Google Classroom
If a student or class roster is updated in Google Classroom, follow these steps to refresh the data in ClassSwift:
  * Go to **My Class** and click the **Google Classroom** button.
  * Click **Refresh** , select the updated class, and import again.
