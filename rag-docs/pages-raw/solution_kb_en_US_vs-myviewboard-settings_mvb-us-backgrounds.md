# Backgrounds
Use the **Backgrounds** page to select the image that appears as your default canvas background within myViewBoard after signing in. You also have the option to select images stored in your connected cloud storage.
  

  

## Background sources
Backgrounds can be selected from the following options:  
  

  * **myViewBoard default**.   
Default images that come installed with myViewBoard. These are the same backgrounds that can be selected within the myViewBoard app.  
  

  * **ViewSonic Originals**.   
Images that are provided by ViewSonic originals. Click on a category on the top bar to show only the images for that category. Click search to filter the list based on name.  
  

  * **Cloud drive**.   
Images saved in the integrated Cloud drive service that is currently set as the default. Note that only one service can be loaded at a time. To add more images, click **Update files** to open the Cloud drive in a new browser window.   
  



  

To select a default background, perform the following:
  

  * Click `Set as default` to set the current image as the default background.
  * Click `Clear default` to remove the current image as the default background.


  

  

If no background is set, myViewBoard displays a blank white canvas after signing in. If a default background is set, the following occurs after signing in to myViewBoard: 
  * myViewBoard automatically applies the background on pages where a background has not been explicitly set. 
  * myViewBoard automatically applies the background on all new pages.


  

  

## Adding Images
Before proceeding, connect a cloud drive service with your myViewBoard account. This process triggers the creation of a **myViewBoard** folder on the root of the cloud drive. This folder contains a set of pre-defined subdirectories where myViewBoard stores important assets. 
  

To have custom images appear in the settings page, upload your background images to this subdirectory: 
  * **myViewBoard » Background**


  

There are several options to add images to this directory:
  

_Add via apps integrated with the Windows desktop:_
  1. Use your cloud service app (like OneDrive and Google Drive) to perform a sync.   
Ensure that the latest folders are included.
  2. Use Windows Explorer to navigate to the **myViewBoard » Background** folder. 
  3. Drag and drop images into this folder.
  4. Head over to 
    1. Go to the **Settings » Background** page 
    2. Refresh the page.
  5. All recently added images should appear in the tab for your connected Cloud service.


  

_Add via the website of your cloud service provider:_
  1. Launch the website of your cloud service app
  2. Navigate to the **myViewBoard » Background** folder. 
  3. Drag and drop images into this folder.
  4. Head over to 
    1. Go to the **Settings » Background** page 
    2. Refresh the page.
  5. All recently added images should appear in the tab for your connected Cloud service.


  

_Add within the myViewBoard settings page:_
  1. In the Background page, click the **Update Files** button.   
This opens the **Background** folder of your cloud storage.
  2. Upload your **image files** to this folder.
  3. Return to the Background page and refresh the page.
  4. All recently added images should appear in the Cloud service tab.


  

  

Note the following rules for custom background images:
  * Background images can be of any resolution. However, it is highly recommended to use **4K**(3840 x 2160 pixels) images so images are not distorted they are applied as backgrounds. 
  * Only **JPG, PNG,** and **BMP** files are supported. 


  

  

## Within myViewBoard
The myViewBoard app provides a built-in way to change background images during a session, or to set a different background for selected pages during lesson preparation. For more details, refer to the following article:
