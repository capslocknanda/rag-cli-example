# Teacher View: Quiz Collection in ClassSwift Hub
The **Quiz Collection** feature on **ClassSwift Hub** allows teachers to view and access quizzes that were previously saved in the **ClassSwift App**.  
This update connects the app and hub so that any quiz saved in the app — whether generated by AI or captured from a screenshot — now appears automatically on the Hub.
**Overview**
Quiz Collection on the Hub provides a convenient way for teachers to organize and review their saved quizzes directly from a web browser.  
Previously, quiz management was available only in the **ClassSwift App**.  
With this update, teachers can now access their existing quizzes in one place for easier preparation and lesson planning.
**Accessing Quiz Collection**
  1. Log in to **ClassSwift Hub**
  2. From the left sidebar, select **Quiz Collection**.
  3. Use the filters at the top to narrow your view:
     * **Quiz Category** – Choose between quiz that is your content or AI-generated.
     * **Quiz Type** – Choose quiz format (Multiple Choice / True or False).
     * **Time** – Filter quizzes by save date (options include: anytime, last 7 days, last 30 days, and last 6 months).
  4. Your quizzes will appear as cards in the main area, organized under the **Folder List** on the left.


**Folder List and Quiz Cards**
  * **Folder List** – Displays your available quiz folders such as _Home_ or custom subjects 
  * **Quiz Cards** – Each card includes:
    * Quiz content
    * Category label (e.g., History, Science)
    * Question type (Multiple Choice or True/False)


You can browse and preview your saved quizzes, but editing and management options are not yet available from the Hub.
**How It Works**
The Hub automatically syncs quizzes saved from the **ClassSwift App >> Preset Quiz**.  
This includes:
  * **AI-generated quizzes** created through the app’s quiz generator
  * **Screenshot-based quizzes** saved from lesson materials


Once saved in the app, the quiz appears instantly in **Quiz Collection** on the Hub under your account.
**Current Limitations**
  * Quiz Collection on the Hub is **view-only** for now.
  * Each account can view up to **5 quizzes** under the Lite Plan paywall limit.
  * Quizzes must first be saved in the **ClassSwift App** before appearing in the Hub.
