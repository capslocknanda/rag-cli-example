# Shape Pen
Use the **Shape Pen** page to specify a default image when the Shape Pen feature is activated. You also have the option to use images stored in your connected cloud storage.
  

  

## Image sources
Images can be selected from the following options:  
  

  * **myViewBoard default**.   
Default images that come installed with myViewBoard. These are the same images that can be selected within the myViewBoard app.  
  

  * **Cloud drive**.   
Images saved in the integrated Cloud drive service that is currently set as the default. Note that only one service can be loaded at a time. To add more images, click **Update files** to open the Cloud drive in a new browser window.   
  



  

To select a default image, perform the following:
  

  * Click `Set as default` to set the current image as the default image.
  * Click `Clear default` to remove the current image as the default image.


  

  

## Adding Images
Before proceeding, connect a cloud drive service with your myViewBoard account. This process triggers the creation of a **myViewBoard** folder on the root of the cloud drive. This folder contains a set of pre-defined subdirectories where myViewBoard stores important assets. 
  

To have custom images appear in the settings page, upload them to this subdirectory: 
  * **myViewBoard » Shape Pen**


  

There are several options to add images to this directory:
  

_Add via apps integrated with the Windows desktop:_
  1. Use your cloud service app (like OneDrive and Google Drive) to perform a sync.   
Ensure that the latest folders are included.
  2. Use Windows Explorer to navigate to the **myViewBoard » Shape Pen** folder. 
  3. Drag and drop images into this folder.
  4. Head over to 
    1. Go to the **Settings » Shape Pen** page 
    2. Refresh the page.
  5. All recently added images should appear in the tab for your connected Cloud service.


  

_Add via the website of your cloud service provider:_
  1. Launch the website of your cloud service app
  2. Navigate to the **myViewBoard » Shape Pen** folder. 
  3. Drag and drop images into this folder.
  4. Head over to 
    1. Go to the **Settings » Shape Pen** page 
    2. Refresh the page.
  5. All recently added images should appear in the tab for your connected Cloud service.


  

_Add within the myViewBoard settings page:_
  1. In the **Shape Pen** page, click the **Update Files** button.   
This opens the **Shape Pen** folder of your cloud storage.
  2. Upload your **image files** to this folder.
  3. Return to the **Shape Pen** page and refresh the page.
  4. All recently added images should appear in the Cloud service tab.


  

  

Note the following rules for custom images:
  * Images can be of any resolution. However, it is highly recommended to use high resolution images so they are not blurry or distorted once they appear on the canvas. 
  * Only **JPG, PNG,** and **BMP** files are supported.
