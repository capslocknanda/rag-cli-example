# Entity list
The myViewBoard Admin Settings page now shows the entity currently loaded and the owner email. This makes it easy for admins to identify which entity they are making changes to.
  

To load settings for another entity, click the **Entity list** on the sidepanel. The **Entity list** allows admins to switch between multiple entities.
