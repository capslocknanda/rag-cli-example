# Quick connect
Quick Connect is a feature in AirSync sender that allows users to search for nearby IFPs that they can use for sharing. To start sharing, users can simply select their target IFP from a list, without manually typing a display code and one-time password.
  

## Use Quick Connect
Verify first that your network already have IFPs that have AirSync up and running. Afterwards, perform the following steps:
  

  

_On the target IFP:_
  

  1. Open the AirSync app. 
  2. Note the following details: 
    1. Name of the board
    2. Display code   
  

  3. Leave the app running, then head over to your device.


  

  

  

  

_On the target device:_
  

  1. Launch AirSync Sender. 
  2. Click **Device List**.
  3. On the next page, perform the following:
     * Allow some time for the app to scan for nearby IFPs. This may take a few minutes.
     * Select the entry that matches the board name and display code of the IFP you want to connect to.   
  

  

  4. Click **Next**.
  5. On the next page, click **Share**.   
  

  

  6. Select a view to share, then click **Share**.  
  

  

  7. The IFP should now start showing the contents playing on the device's screen.


  

  

## Auto-fill password 
To require participants to input the one-time password every time they need to share: 
  

  1. On the target IFP, tap **Settings**.
  2. Tap **Auto-fill one-time password** to remove the check. By default, this option is enabled.
  3. Back in your device, use **Quick Connect** to share your screen to the target IFP.
  4. The AirSync sender app should now prompt you for the one-time password.
  5. Type the password and proceed as usual.
