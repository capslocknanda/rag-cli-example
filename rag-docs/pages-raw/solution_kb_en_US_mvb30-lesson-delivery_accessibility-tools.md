# Accessibility tools
myViewBoard includes several tools to support accessibility and make it easier for all students to interact and participate with your lessons. The sections below provide a brief overview of myViewBoard features designed to enhance focus, improve readability, and assist with auditory and visual needs.
  

## Inclusivity tools
A brief description of each tool is given below. Links to the full description is provided.
  

  

| 
### Spotlight
Dims non-essential areas of the screen with the Spotlight feature to draw focus to key content. Use it to minimize distractions and keep attention centered during presentations or lessons.   
  
---|---  
| 
### Immersive Reader
Transforms text into an accessible format by activating Immersive Reader, offering features like text-to-speech, adjustable fonts, and line spacing. This feature aims to support learning differences and language needs by enhancing readability and comprehension.   
  
| 
### Text-to-Speech
Converts written text into spoken words using Text-to-Speech for auditory learning. This feature targets users with visual impairments or those who prefer listening over reading.   
  
| 
### Magnifier
Zooms in on specific areas of the screen with Magnifiers to provide better clarity for intricate visuals. This tool is ideal for users with visual impairments or those needing detailed examination.   
  
| 
### Speech-to-Text (STT)
Transcribes spoken words into text in real-time using Speech-to-Text for quick and accurate note-taking. This can make your lessons more accessible for users with limited typing abilities or those requiring transcription support.   
  
| 
### Live Captions
Generates real-time captions for spoken audio with Live Caption to ensure accessibility. This can efficiently enhance understanding during presentations, meetings, or video playback for users with hearing impairments.  
  
  
| 
### Irlen Background 
Background color presets selected from commonly used Irlen filter tints to help reduce perceived visual strain during screen use. These colors may improve figure-ground separation for users with visual-sensitivity needs.  
  
  
  
| 
### Participate mode
Use during class to generate a canvas that is divided into sections for collaborative student activities. This mode empowers learners to work together in a shared digital space.
