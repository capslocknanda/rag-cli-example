# New user onboarding
This article give a quick introduction of the **ViewSonic myViewBoard** onboarding process.
  

  

## ViewSonic dashboard first sign-in
We recommend going over the tutorial first:
  

  1. When you first sign-in, a quick tutorial guide pops up for the ViewSonic Dashboard. 
  2. Click **Check the tutorial** to navigate across the UI and go through a brief onboarding of the interface. 


  

  

Once complete, users can get started with myViewBoard.
  

  1. Click the **myViewBoard** tile.
  2. Click **myViewBoard****Settings** from the dropdown.   
  
Alternatively, simply clicking the **myViewboard** tile will bring up the **myViewBoard Settings** page.  
  
  
  

  3. If this is the user's first log-in, users need to: 
    1. Select their role: Principal, IT Admin, Teacher, or Minor [1]
    2. Agree to the Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and EULA
    3. Agree to the ViewSonic Educator Community account [2]
  
  
  

  4. Click **Next**.  
  

  5. Afterwards, we highly recommend that users connect a cloud account to seamlessly integrate myViewBoard with their own cloud services. 
    1. Click **Connect now** or **Skip.**
    2. myViewBoard will redirect users to the **App & Cloud Integration** page. 
    3. Click the **Link** icon to connect a cloud account.  

  6. You are all set! Welcome to ViewSonic myViewBoard. Feel free to start exploring **myViewBoard Settings** more. 


  

  

## Connect a cloud account
## Link an account
  

  

### Microsoft SSO sign-in for first-time users 
[1] Signing in with Microsoft SSO will cause a **OneDrive integration window** to appear before choosing a role. 
  * This will require users to click "**Sign-in to Microsoft** " to allow access and bind the user's OneDrive account. 
  * This allows school IT to quickly help teachers bind their OneDrive accounts via Microsoft SSO.


  

  

## MS Integration window
## MS Permissions
  

  

### ViewSonic Educator Community 
[2] If you agree to create a community account: 
  * A new window automatically opens to guide users through the creation of a community account. If they are currently on full screen, this window may open in a new tab and automatically close.
  * Users will receive an auto-generated system email welcoming them to the community. Please note that the system email is in English only.
