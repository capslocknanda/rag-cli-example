# Network requirements
For optimal performance, verify that the network where AirSync and the AirSync client operates has the firewall configured to allow the following connections:
  

## Relay connection
Relay connections are used in scenarios where direct connections between devices are not possible due to network configurations.
  

### With wildcards
  * TCP 443 for _*.myviewboard.cloud_
  * TCP 443 for _*.myviewboard.com_
  * TCP 443 for _*.viewsonic.com_
  * TCP 443 for _*.airsync.net_


  

### Without wildcards
For firewalls that don't allow wildcards.
  

  * TCP 443 for _airsync.net_ , _www.airsync.net_ , _airsync.viewsonic.com_
  * TCP 443 for:
    * _api.gateway.airsync.net_
    * _us-east-1.gateway.airsync.net_
    * _ap-northeast-1.gateway.airsync.net_
  * TCP 443 for _appconfig.airsync.net_
  * TCP 443 for _getice.myviewboard.cloud_
  * TCP 443 for _store2.myviewboard.com_ (OTA)
  * TCP 443 for _store2.airsync.net_ (OTA)


  

### Video/Audio (WebRTC)
  * TCP 443 for _turn.myviewboard.cloud_
  * TCP 3478 for _turn.myviewboard.cloud_
  * UDP 3478 for _turn.myviewboard.cloud_ (Optional)
  * Local UDP ports _32768~61000_


  

  

## Local Connection (Direct connection)
Establish a network connection directly between devices within the LAN without relying on external servers or services.
  * TCP 5001


  

### Remote Screen
  * TCP 7000


  

### Video/Audio (WebRTC)
  * Random UDP ports in the range of _32768~61000_


  

### Mirror
AirPlay, Googlecast, and Miracast do not require access to the Internet.
  

  * _AirPlay, Google Cast_
    * Does not work in different subnet/VLAN
    * Random UDP ports in the range of  _32768~61000_  
  

  * _Miracast_
    * Use Wi-Fi Direct (WiFi P2P). Does not require wireless AP.


  

  

## Bandwidth requirements
To improve image quality and user experience, ensure that the network bandwidth should be at least: 
  * 5Mbps for a WebRTC session casting on full HD, or 
  * 15Mbps for a WebRTC session casting on higher resolutions 


  

The casting resolution is determined by:
  * Resolution of the sharing screen, and
  * If "High image quality" setting is active


  

If the "High image quality" is: 
  

  * **OFF** :   
Max casting resolution up to QHD (2K), if the device sharing its screen supports this resolution.   
  

  * **ON** :   
Max casting resolution goes up to UHD (4K), if the device sharing its screen supports this resolution. 


  

To compute for total network bandwidth usage, multiply the minimum bandwidth per session by the number of concurrent sessions.
  

  

## Miscellaneous info
Note the following information for the systems mentioned below.
  

  * **Ephemeral port range on Android or Linux**


Use the following command:
```
adb shell cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
```

  

  * **Limit WebRTC port range in Chrome**


Chrome policies (WebRtcUdpPortRange) can limit the range of local UDP ports used by WebRTC. Refer to setting UDP port ranges in the following page:
