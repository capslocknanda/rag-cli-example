# AI dashboard
The **AI Dashboard** allows users to generate and manage a single, entity-specific dashboard. It organizes information into customizable cards that simplify monitoring and analysis of entity activity into one central area.
## Create a dashboard
On the left panel, click **AI Dashboard** to create a dashboard. You will have the following options on the next page:
  

  

**Auto-generate a dashboard**
Provide a prompt to create a dashboard with relevant data.
  

**Pick a sample question**
Manually select which items should appear in the dashboard. Items are grouped into categories.
  

  

Allow some time for the dashboard to be generated. You will be automatically redirected to your dashboard once it's done. Note that only one dashboard is allowed per entity.
  

  

  

## Customize the Dashboard
After generating your dashboard, review the cards that display your requested data. Manage and customize your dashboard as follows:
  

To manage the cards on your dashboard, hover over a card and perform one of the following:
  

  * **Move a card**  
Drag the card title to a new location. To facilitate more efficient reviews, position related cards adjacent to each other.  
  

  * **Resize a card**  
Drag the sizing handle in the lower right corner. You can expand cards with more important information so they take up more space.  
  

  * **Delete a card**  
Click the 


  

  

## Move
## Resize
## Delete
  

  

  

If you want to add more cards, perform the following:
  

  1. Click the **+ Add data blocks** dropdown.
  2. Perform one of the following:
    1. Enter a prompt describing the information to add.
    2. Select a category and choose one or more cards to include. Each card includes a brief description of the data they contain. Note that any statistic / number / data shown on the selection pane is purely cosmetic and does not reflect real-time entity info.  
  

  3. Insights adds your new card as the last item on the dashboard. 
  4. Customize or manage the new card as preferred.


  

  

  

## Dashboard Settings
By default, new dashboards use the title **AI Dashboard**. Click the icons under the dashboard title to access the following options:
  

  * **Rename**   
Update the title. Provide a descriptive title that does not exceed 50 characters, then click **Save**. This new title will also be used on the left panel.   
  

  * **Delete dashboard**   
Remove the current dashboard. Note that this action cannot be undone. Deleting a dashboard allows you to generate a new dashboard again.


  

  

## Additional details
Note the following behavior:
  

  * Remember that AI isn't perfect and may occasionally misinterpret your request.
  * The AI Dashboard allows 20 responses per session. This allows you to try out different dashboard variations to help decide on what data types are useful.
  * We highly recommend exploring the other sections first to get a general idea of what information should appear on the dashboard.
