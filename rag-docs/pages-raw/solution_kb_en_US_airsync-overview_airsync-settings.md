# AirSync settings
AirSync provides settings that allows users to customize their casting experience.
  

## Access settings on the IFP
To open AirSync on the IFP, perform the following:
  

  1. Open the AirSync app.
  2. Click the **Settings** icon on the bottom left.
  3. Review the options available.   
Click a section on the side panel to display the options available for that section.
  4. Make any changes necessary. 
  5. Click 


  

Note that most changes are immediately applied. To verify, start a sharing session and check that AirSync behaves as expected.
  

  

## AirSync Settings
AirSync provides the following options:
  

### Device Setting
These are general settings that control how AirSync looks and interacts with other devices.
  

  * **Device name**.   
Specify a unique, descriptive name that identifies this IFP on the network.  
  

  * **Language**.   
Indicate the language that AirSync uses to display text and messages on the UI.   
  

  * **Show display code on top**.   
Keep the code visible at the top of the screen, even when switching to other apps and screen sharing is active.  
  

  * **If invited to display group**.   
Specify how AirSync should respond when it receives a request to join a display group.  
  

  * **Auto-fill one-time password**.   
Enable one-touch connection when the IFP is selected from the Sender app's Quick Connect menu.  
  

  * **Require approval for all screen sharing requests**.  
All screen sharing requests must be manually approved to continue.   
  



  

  

  

### Broadcast
Options for casting the contents of the IFP screen to other devices.
  

  * **Cast to devices**.   
Share the contents of the IFP screen to multiple devices, including laptops, tablets and mobile devices simultaneously. For more details, refer to the article here:  
  
[Share IFP to other devices](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/share-ifp-to-device)  
  

  * **Cast to boards**.   
Share the contents of the IFP screen to all Interactive Flat Panels (IFPs) in the same network. For more details, refer to the article here:  
  
[Share IFP to IFP](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/share-ifp-to-ifp)  
  



  

  

  

### Mirroring
If AirSync Sender is not available, AirSync also supports receiving request from other casting protocols. Once accepted, the IFP mirrors the content of the device sending the request. 
  

  * **AirPlay**.   
Receive a screen from an Apple device using an AirPlay connection.  
  

  * **Require passcode**.   
If AirPlay is enabled, users must input a passcode each time a connection is made.  
  

  * **Google Cast**.   
Receive a screen using a connection from a Chromium-based browser, an Android smartphone, or any device that supports Google Cast.  
  

  * **Miracast**.   
Receive a screen using a Miracast connection. Miracast can be found on selected smartphones, laptops, or PCs with supported hardware.   
  

  * **Auto Accept**.   
Accept all request without any additional prompts. The IFP immediately mirrors any content sent to it. If disabled, users must confirm the request before the mirroring starts.  
  



  

  

  

### Connectivity
Specify a connection source that AirSync will monitor for share and receive requests.  
  

  * **Both internet & local connection**.   
Accept share and receive requests that originate from both internet and local connections.  
  

  * **Local connection**.   
Accept share and receive requests that originate from local connections only. Local connections operate within a private network, offering more security and stability.  
  

  * **Internet connection**.   
Accept share and receive requests that originate from internet connections only. Internet connection requires a stable network.
