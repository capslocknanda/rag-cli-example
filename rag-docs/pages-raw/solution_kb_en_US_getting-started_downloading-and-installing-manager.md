# Install Manager app
The **Manager web console** is accessible only to Entity Admins and Entity Owners who are signed in in to myviewboard.com. Only registered devices appear in the Manager web console. 
  

To register a device to an entity for management in the console, the Manager Android app _must be installed_ on the target device. 
  

Since all ViewSonic Interactive Flat Panels (IFPs) have Android as the default operating system, **Manager is usually preinstalled** on ViewSonic devices, including but not limited to:  
  

  * All ViewBoard models
  * ViewBoard Box-connected devices
  * CDE12 and CDE20 series displays
  * Select ViewSonic LED displays running Android 7 or higher


  

Follow the steps below to install the Manager app on your target device only if the Manager app is missing on your ViewSonic device.
  

## Before installing
Before proceeding, prepare the target device by performing the following first:
  

### Download the APK
Have the Manager APK ready, either on a flash drive or downloaded directly on the device. To download: 
  

  1. Use an Entity account to sign into 
  2. Click the **Downloads** link on the side.
  3. Click the   
  



  

### Enable install from unknown sources
Enable the **Allow installation of apps from unknown sources** permission on the target device. Note that enabling this setting varies based on your IFP model. For some examples, refer to the following pages:  
  

  * [How to install custom apps in the Android module for IFP50 series displays?](https://support.viewsonic.com/en/support/solutions/articles/33000210632-how-to-install-custom-apps-in-the-android-module-for-ifp50-series-displays)
  * [Google Play store not found on IFP](https://support.viewsonic.com/en/support/solutions/articles/33000239803-google-play-store-not-found-on-ifp-)


  

These more or less follow the standard procedures for enabling the setting. If in doubt, consult your IFP's user manual for instructions on installing APK files. If you need further assistance, try to [find your answers here](https://support.viewsonic.com/en/support/solutions/33000134367 "find your answers here"), or contact your IFP reseller for more details.
  

  

### Whitelist domains
Whitelist the following domains to access Manager and manage devices:
  

Domain | Description  
---|---  
*myviewboard.com | Required for the web applications ecosystem to function  
*myviewboard.cloud | Required for proper functioning of web service resources  
*firebraseio.com | Used by video and audio streaming features  
*amazonaws.com | Used by AWS services  
  

[Delete](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/getting-started/downloading-and-installing-manager)
**NOTE ON FORMATTING**
Ensure to include the asterisk (*) where shown in the above domains.
  

### Open ports
Some features require specific ports to be open. For **Remote Control** features: open TCP Port 443 on your network. For the [Remote Desktop](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/manager-advanced-features/remote-desktop "Remote Desktop in Manager Advanced") feature ([Manager Advanced](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/manager-advanced-features/overview "MyViewBoard Manager Advanced") users only), whitelist the following ports and services:
  

Port | Service  
---|---  
TCP 443 | mrtc.myviewboard.cloud  
TCP 443 | getice.myviewboard.cloud  
TCP 443 | ice.myviewboard.cloud  
TCP 3478 | ice.myviewboard.cloud  
UDP 3478 | ice.myviewboard.cloud  
UDP 1024-65535 | Peer-to-peer connection should be allowed   
(optional, but enables better performance)  
  

  

### Update firmware
Update your ViewSonic device to the latest firmware version. Firmware that is out of date may not be compatible with later versions of Manager. For a quick visual guide, watch the video below:

## Install the Manager APK
  

Once everything is ready, perform the following steps:
  

  1. Copy the APK file you downloaded earlier to the target device.
  2. Use the ViewBoard's file manager app to navigate to the specific folder where the APK file was copied.
  3. Tap on the APK file to start the installation process.  
  

  4. Tap **Install** when the prompt asking if you want to install the application appears. You may need to accept permissions that the app requires before proceeding with the installation.
  5. Wait for the installation process to complete. It usually takes a few seconds.  
  

  6. Once installed, you will see a confirmation message. You can either: 
    1. Tap **Open** to launch the app immediately or 
    2. Tap **Done** to exit the installer.


  

  

To verify if installation was successful, perform the following:
  1. Launch the IFP's app list.
  2. Locate and tap the new **Manager** app.   
You may need to expand the list, depending on the launcher version.
  3. The following screen should appear.   
Tap **Dismiss** or tap anywhere outside the modal to close.


  

  

After verifying that the app was installed successfully, you can now register the device with Manager. Kindly refer to the article below:
