# Install apps via Manager
Remotely install apps into one or more devices. 
  

## Install apps
To install apps via Manager, follow the steps below:
  

  1. Click **Devices** on the left sidepanel.
    1. Navigate to the **All Devices** tab. 
    2. On the device list, select target devices for installation.  
  

  2. Click **Apps** on the top toolbar.
  3. Click **Install** from the dropdown.  
  

  4. In the popup:
    1. Select apps to install. *
    2. Click **Confirm**.  
  

  5. App installation begins after the _command has been sent_. message appears.


  

* To add your own apps to this list, see the [Upload custom apps](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/managing-devices/install-apps#upload-custom-apps-2) section below.
  

  

## Uninstall apps
To uninstall apps via Manager, follow the steps below:
  

  1. Click **Devices** on the left sidepanel.
    1. Navigate to the **All Devices** tab. 
    2. On the device list, select target devices for installation.  
  

  2. Click **Apps** on the top toolbar.
  3. Click **Uni****nstall** from the dropdown.  
  

  4. In the popup:
    1. Select apps to uninstall. *
    2. Click **Confirm**.  
  

  5. App uninstallation begins after the _command has been sent_. message appears.


  

* Note that there might be some cases when Manager may not be able to uninstall selected apps. [See here for more information](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/managing-devices/install-apps#uninst-limit).
  

  

## Upload custom apps
If you have custom apps that you need to install, you will need to upload them in Manager's **Apps** section before they can be deployed to devices. Note that only the APK file format is supported. 
  

To upload a custom app, follow the steps below:  
  

  1. Click **Apps** on the left sidepanel.
  2. Click   
  

  3. Use the popup to upload APK files from your local drive:
    1. Drag and drop files into the pop-up, or
    2. Click **Browse files** and select files from your file browser.   
The max file size allowed for upload is 500 MB.
    3. Click **Confirm** to start the upload.  
  

  4. Wait for the upload to complete. 
  5. Once done, the new apps should now appear in the **Uploaded Apps** tab.


  

  

## App availability 
Note the following considerations for specific apps:  
  

  * **myViewBoard compatibility**.   
Different devices support different versions of myviewboard. When targeting different device models, Manager will auto-detect the correct version of myViewBoard to install. Note that older devices may not be compatible with the most recent myViewBoard versions.  
  

  * **Approved 3rd party apps**.   
A set of approved 3rd party apps is also available by default. The list of apps may grow over time and is subject to change. We highly recommend performing a regular review of the release notes for the latest updates.  
  

  * **Uploaded apps.**  
If you have custom apps that you need to install, you will need to upload them in Manager's Apps section before they can be deployed to devices. The max file size allowed for upload is 500 MB.  
  

  * **Uninstall limitations**.   
Manager can only manage apps that have been installed through the Manager console. The Manager console cannot uninstall apps that: 
    * Came pre-installed on the device, or 
    * Manually installed by running the APK on the device itself.  
  

  * **Hiding apps**.   
If simply hiding apps is sufficient, devices with a Manager Advanced license can set whether a given app will be accessible on a device. When hidden, these apps will not be uninstalled from the device but they will not be presented on the devices's launcher or app menu.
