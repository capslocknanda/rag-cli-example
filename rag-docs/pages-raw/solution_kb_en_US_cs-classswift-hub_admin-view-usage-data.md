# Admin View - Usage Data
The **Usage Data** page in **ClassSwift Hub (Admin View)** provides a summary of lesson activity across all teachers in your organization.  
Administrators can review teaching time, session counts, and active-user statistics within a selected date range.
**Overview**
Usage Data helps admins monitor classroom engagement and platform usage.  
You can filter data by date, check total lesson hours, and export records for analysis.
**Accessing Usage Data**
  1. Log in with your **Admin** account.
  2. In the left sidebar, click **Usage Data**.
  3. Use the calendar fields to select a start and end date.
  4. Click **Search** to update the report or **Export** to download it as CSV/Excel.


**Main Metrics**
The top summary cards show the overall usage during the selected period:
  * **Total Lesson Sessions (Time)** – Total hours of lessons conducted.
  * **Total Lesson Count** – Number of individual lesson sessions held.
  * **Active Users** – Number of teachers who conducted lessons within the range.


**Teacher Usage Table**
Below the summary cards is a detailed table of teacher-level data.
**Column** | **Description**  
---|---  
**User** | Teacher name or account ID  
**Lesson Sessions** | Total accumulated session time (HH:MM:SS)  
**Lesson Count** | Number of sessions conducted  
**Avg. Lesson Sessions** | Average session duration  
**Last Lesson Start Time** | Date and time of the teacher’s most recent session  
The table can be sorted by **Lesson Sessions** or **Lesson Count** for quick comparison.
**Exporting Data**
  * Click **Export** in the top-right corner to download a full report in CSV format.
  * Exported data includes all columns shown in the table and can be used for attendance tracking, performance summaries, or audit reports.


**Tips**
  * Narrow the date range for faster report loading.
  * If a teacher’s name does not appear, they may not have conducted lessons within the chosen period.
  * For privacy, exported files should only be shared within your organization.
