# Entity types
The [Entity Request Form](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/entity-setup/request-entity-account) will ask organizations to specify an **Entity type**. Regional representatives will review whether this entity type is appropriate for a given organization.
  

## Entity types
myViewBoard categorizes entities into three types. These types are based on the email domain the entity will register as their **main domain**.
  

  1. **Individual**   
This type is for  _single organizations_ that use a unique registered email domain. All members in this entity belong to the same organization. Users must use the same email domain to be added into this entity type.  
  

  2. **Shared**   
This type is for _a set of organizations_ that share the same email domain. For example, an educational bureau creates an email domain to be used by all schools in its region. Similar to the **Individual** entity type, only users with the same email domain can be included in this entity type.  
  

  3. **Public**   
Organizations that are registered under _a free email public domain_ , such as Google and Yahoo. These organizations do not have a unique registered domain. This type supports adding users with different email domains. A **Public** type entity can accommodate a maximum of 1,000 users.


  

  

The domain you register with your entity will be set as your **main domain**. For more information about domains, see the article below:
