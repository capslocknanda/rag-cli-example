# Back Up and Restore
Use the **Back Up and Restore** feature to: 
  * Manually or automatically create a restore point to back up the system 
  * Select a restore point later to revert to a previous state 


  

## Backup details
Once a restore point is created, the following items are backed up: 
  * Device list
  * Groups
  * Jobs
  * Advanced license assignments


  

  
There are a limited number of slots for restore points, depending on the license:
  

Basic | 1 restore point  
---|---  
Advanced | 15 restore points  
  

If there are no empty slots, the oldest restore point will be overwritten by a new one, but you can lock a restore point to prevent overwriting.
  

  

## Create a Restore point
Create restore points on the **Back Up and Restore** popup. To launch this popup, perform the following:
  

  1. Click **Settings** at the top toolbar of Manager console.
  2. Click **Backup and Restore** from the dropdown.


  

On the popup, admins have two options to create restore points:
  

_Method 1: Scheduling_
  1. Toggle **Scheduling** on.
  2. Click **Edit**.
  3. Set a schedule for the automatic system backup.
  4. Click **Confirm**.


  

_Method 2: Manually create a restore point._
  1. Click the **Create** button.
  2. Click **Yes** to confirm.


  

  

## Manage restore points
Once created, you have the following options to manage restore points:
  

  1. Click **Settings** at the top toolbar of Manager console.
  2. Click **Backup and Restore** from the dropdown.
  3. Under **Date and Time** , hover over a restore point.  
  
Note the following icons on the end:
  

| Prevents this restore point from being overwritten. Once active, the icon should appear blue   
---|---  
| Loads this restore point. Click **Yes** to confirm you want to restore the system to this point.  
| Removes this restore point from this list. This action cannot be undone.
