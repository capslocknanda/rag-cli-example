    2. Click **Download Now** to scroll to the download section.  
  

  3. To start the download, click the correct file type for your target environment.
  4. Allow some time for the download to finish.

## Other installer locations
Alternatively, you can download the latest installers from the links below:
  

### ClassSwift bundle
If you don’t have ClassSwift yet, download the installer below.   
  

  

The installer will automatically detect your setup and only install the needed apps:
  * If ClassSwift is installed, only myViewBoard 3.0 will be added. 
  * If neither is installed, both apps will be installed.


  

  

## After install
Both myViewBoard for Windows 2.0 and myViewBoard for Windows 3.0 are capable of handling .olf files. If you have both myViewBoard for Windows 2.0 and 3.0 installed: 
  

  1. Click an .olf file to display a system prompt window asking you to choose the version of myViewBoard for Windows you want to use. 
  2. Select myViewBoard 3.0 to experience the latest features, improved performance, and new UI. It also supports .olf files created using the classic 2.0 version. 
  3. (Optional) Check "Always use this app" if you want to set a default as a prefered version.


  

  

## Troubleshooting
We've compiled the most common questions related to the installation and deployment of myViewBoard 3.0 instances.
  

How do I install myViewBoard for Windows 3.0?
Three installation options are available. Choose the option that best fits your requirements:
  

1. **EXE Installer**   
_. Recommended for general users.
    * Uses Microsoft App Installer (MSI-based). 
    * Supports automatic updates—your software will update to the latest version within ~8 hours of a new release. 
    * Suitable for manual installation by individual users. 
    * Download link:   



  

2. **MSI Installer**   
_. Recommended for IT deployment.
    * Ideal for large-scale deployment; can be integrated with GPO, Microsoft Intune, or other deployment tools. 
    * Can also be installed manually on standalone devices. 
    * Download link:   



  

_. For more information, see our deployment guides below:
    * [Deploying MSI](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/mvb30-deploying-msi)
    * [Deploying MSI via InTune](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/deploying-msi-via-intune)


  

3. **Microsoft Store Version**  
_. Search “myViewBoard” in Microsoft Store to download directly. 
    * This version is a separate package from the EXE/MSI versions, meaning both can coexist on the same system. 
    * If both are installed: two “myViewBoard” apps will appear, which may cause confusion. 
    * We do not recommend using both Store and traditional installer versions simultaneously. Please choose one based on your needs.  
  



  

Errors installing myViewBoard 3.0 EXE from the official website?
myViewBoard for Windows 3.0 adopts Microsoft’s latest MSI packaging architecture and relies on Microsoft **App Installer** for installation and future automatic updates. Before installation, please ensure the following system requirements are met:
  

  * Microsoft App Installer is correctly installed 
  * Windows Update service is not disabled or restricted 


  

  

Some common error scenarios and their solutions:
  

_App Installer is missing or not properly installed_
On some Windows devices (especially older versions of Windows 10), App Installer may not be pre-installed or may not be fully functional, resulting in failed installations via EXE. To resolve this issue, we provide two types of full installation packages, both of which include the latest App Installer:
  

📦 
📦 
  

Using either package ensures a complete environment and avoids manual troubleshooting for App Installer issues. Alternatively, you can also manually install or repair App Installer based on the instructions outlined in the doc below:
  

[Installing or Repairing App Installer (Windows 10/11)](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/mvb30-config-setup/3439626-fix-install-issues)
  

_Installation error with code 0x80070422 or similar_
This error typically indicates that the Windows Update service is disabled or restricted, which is common in school or enterprise environments. Since the App Installer depends on Windows Update to complete installation, this will prevent the EXE installer from working correctly. The recommended workaround is to use the MSI installer instead, which does not rely on Windows Update:
  

  

  

  

  

Is myViewBoard for Windows 3.0 installed per-user or system-wide?
When installed via .MSI, myViewBoard is installed at the system level by default. However, when installed via .EXE (App Installer), myViewBoard is installed at the user profile level (per user). 
  

If you want to install by machine (system-wide), you need to use deployment tools (e.g., Intune, GPO) or specific install commands. Implementation details may vary, and typically require administrator privileges.
  

We recommend consulting the official documentation of your deployment tool or your IT team’s SOP.
  

  

Installing myViewBoard for Windows 3.0 requires Admin rights?
  * _For single-user installation_ :   
No Admin rights required. Users can install on their own.   
  

  * _For mass deployment or system-wide installation (by machine)_ :   
Depends on the deployment method and policy. If system-level settings need to be modified or cross-user installation is required, Admin rights are usually necessary.
