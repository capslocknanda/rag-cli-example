# Share a TeamOne board
TeamOne provides several methods to share your board with others. Note that users must be assigned with a **Team admin** or **Team member** role to perform the following tasks: 
  

  * Invite users to make edits, or share as view only
  * Share the board for viewing with external clients, no sign up required
  * Assign which users can share the board or grant permissions 


  

  

## Share by email
Share a TeamOne by email if you already have a list of emails on hand. For real-time collaborations, ensure that collaborators have access to their emails since they must check their email to access the board.
  

  1. Open the board to share.
  2. Click the **Share** button on the top right of the board.  
  

  3. On the **Share this board** popup, click the input box under the **By email** label and perform one of the following:
    1. Type an email address of a collaborator. Press **Enter** to save that email as a new entry. Repeat for every collaborator you want to add.
    2. Paste a list of emails addresses from your clipboard. TeamOne will auto-detect each individual email address.  
  

  4. Set **Permission** settings. Note that these permissions will apply to all collaborators added to this list. 
  5. Click **Send invitation**.  
  

  6. Inform the receiving collaborators to check their email and follow the instructions to access the board.


  

  

  

  

## Share by link
Share a TeamOne board via a link that you can paste into instant messages, personalized emails, or discussion forums. 
  

  1. Open the board to share.
  2. Click the **Share** button on the top right of the board.
  3. On the **Share this board** popup, click the **Copy link** button under the **By link** label.
  4. Share the link with your collaborators.  
  

  5. To manage the link, perform one of the following:
    1. Set **Permission** settings. Note that changing this setting will generate a new link for that permission.
    2. Click   
  

  6. Click the **Copy link** button again after making these changes.


  

  

  

  

## Share by QR code
Share a TeamOne board via a QR code. This is recommended for collaborators that are in the same room and have devices that are able to take a photo of the QR code. For other collaborators that do not have such devices, this method also provides a link that can be shared with them as a fallback. 
  

  

  1. Open the board to share.
  2. Click the **QR code** button on the top right of the board.  
Note the board code at the bottom.  
  

  3. On the **Join this board** popup, collaborators may perform one of the following:
    1. Use a mobile device to scan the QR code.
    2. Type the link below the QR code into their browser.  
  

  4. If successful, a page loads for invited users.   
Type the board code when prompted.
  5. Click **Join**.


  

  

  

  

  

## Manage permissions
After users have joined the board, you may want to change permissions for individual users.
  

  1. Open the board to share.
  2. Click the **Share** button on the top right of the board
  3. On the popup, click **Manage access** at the bottom.  
  

  4. On the next page, change the permission for your target user.   
Note that permissions for users in a team or project where that user is a **Team admin** cannot be changed.  

  5. Click **Done** to go back to the previous page.
