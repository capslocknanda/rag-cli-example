If you choose not to, you can always access all thrown files from the **notifications** menu or from the [](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/create-lessons/magic-box) [**Magic Box**](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/create-lessons/magic-box) **>** [](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/student-engagement/throw) [**Throw**](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/student-engagement/throw).

**TEACHER TIP**
Pop Quiz is a great tool to test student understanding of a lesson. However, make sure to show your students how to send responses first.
In myViewBoard Whiteboard, write a question and then demonstrate using the Companion app how to send a response. When sending a response, highlight the different tools students can use when sending a response.
[**Polls**](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/student-engagement/polls) allows a host to create questions in many formats in myViewBoard Whiteboard (Windows-only). Students can then answer using the Polls feature in **Companion App**.
  1. Press the Polls icon and then join by either entering the Whiteboard host name or scanning the **QR code** for the Poll from the Whiteboard session. ([Learn more](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/classroom-engagement/share-whiteboard-session).)
  2. Enter your name and press **Join**.
  3. When the Poll starts on Whiteboard, poll questions will appear in the Companion App.
  4. Select or input answers (depends on the [question type](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/student-engagement/polls#question-types-2)).
  5. Press **submit** an answer.
  6. The response will be logged in the Polls session [for the host to review](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/student-engagement/polls#reviewing-response-results-9).
