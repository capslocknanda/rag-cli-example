# myViewBoard 3.0 FAQs
We've compiled answers to your most common questions.
  

## ⚙️ Installation & Compatibility
  

Who gets the new myViewBoard? 
myViewBoard for Windows, myViewBoard for MacOS/iPad OS and myViewBoard for Android on all supported models will be updated. Unsupported models will continue using the old version to maintain performance efficiency, given their potential memory limitations with the new version. For more details about which models are compatible, see the guide below:
  * [myViewBoard IFP compatibility](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/myviewboard-v3_ifp-compatibility)


  

What are the system requirements for the new myViewBoard? 
System requirements for each platform are:
  * Windows 10 Pro 64-bit, version 19041 and above.
  * macOS 13 or above, iOS 15.5 or above.
  * Devices running up to Android 11 can upgrade to myViewBoard v3

  

How do I install/upgrade myViewBoard? 
  * **For myViewBoard for Windows** :   
No automatic update. You'll need to download and install the new myViewBoard for Windows manually once it's available this summer. For IT admins, we also have an MSI file to help with deployment.  
  

  * **For myViewBoard for Android** :   
These will auto-update. However, all Generation 3 panels and older (check the version on the panel) will not receive the update. For more details about which models are compatible, see the guide below:
    * [myViewBoard IFP compatibility](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/myviewboard-v3_ifp-compatibility)  
  

  * **For MacOS and iPadOS versions** :   
These also get an automatic update after the summer release date.

  

Do I have to update to the new myViewBoard version? 
If you are not ready to update to the new version, don’t worry. You’ll have the option to remain on the legacy version via the update popup window.
  

  

  

## 🚀 Features & Usage
  

Difference between the old and new myViewBoard versions? 
Please check out the key difference chart here. Key highlights include:
  

  * A new UI to give myViewBoard a clean modern look
  * More intuitive icons and descriptions so it's easier to understand what each tool does.
  * Multi-Tab Support to allow opening multiple myViewBoard files at the same time.
  * Enhanced Participate Mode for student collaborations on language learning, math, and science
  * Peer-to-peer learning, handwriting recognition, inclusivity tools and more!


  

For a quick comparison of differences between the new version and the old version, see the guide below:
  * [myViewBoard version comparison](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/myviewboard-v3-vs-v2)

  

What new features are included in the new myViewBoard? 
The new version of myViewBoard introduces several new features designed to enhance accessibility, streamline teaching processes, and support diverse learning needs:
  

  * **Tabs support** , allowing teachers to open and manage multiple lessons simultaneously for smoother lesson transitions and multitasking.
  * **Speech-to-Text** functionalities that improve accessibility, provide language learning support, and enhance efficiency for teachers.
  * **Irlen Filters** with customizable background colors to assist students with dyslexia and ADHD, enhancing their learning experience.
  * Enhanced annotation feedback capabilities in **Participate Mode** , enabling teachers to provide real-time feedback during student collaborations.

  * [myViewBoard version comparison](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/myviewboard-v3-vs-v2)

  

Why are fonts missing in myViewBoard? How does the system handle font replacement? 
Due to differences in system architecture, the naming rule between myViewBoard Classic and the new version of myViewBoard is different. In this case, the system may not find the font in myViewBoard. When this happens, myViewBoard allows users to choose the exact same font style or automatically replace them all from system settings to ensure readability.
  

  

Why does my .olf file look misaligned when opened on an IFP after creating it on my laptop? 
This issue is typically caused by differences in screen resolution between your laptop and the ViewBoard (IFP). The .olf file format preserves component positions based on the resolution and display ratio at the time of creation. When the file is opened on a device with a different resolution or aspect ratio, elements may appear shifted, resized, or out of alignment.  
  

To reduce layout inconsistencies when switching between devices, we recommend the following display settings for optimal compatibility.
  

Device | Recommended Resolution | Aspect Ratio  
---|---|---  
Laptop | 1920 × 1080 (Full HD) | 16:9  
IFP (65"+) | 3840 × 2160 (4K UHD) | 16:9  
  

**Tips:**
  * If creating on a laptop, adjust your display resolution to 1920x1080 (or the IFP’s resolution) before starting your content creation.
  * Avoid placing components too close to the screen edges, where layout shifts are more likely.
  * Use “Snap to Grid” or “Align” tools in myViewBoard to maintain consistency


  

  

  

  

## 🔃 Migration Support
  

Do we have to learn everything over again? 
No, every feature is still there. If anything, we've added additional features, like the highly requested "tabs." Since the new UI looks visually different, we've created a chart to help you identify familiar tools that have been updated to the new look. 
  

  * [myViewBoard version comparison](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/myviewboard-v3-vs-v2)


  

Do I have to pay for this update? 
No, myViewBoard remains free to download. Entities still have free access to all Entity features.
  

Why is ViewSonic doing this? 
myViewBoard was developed back in 2018. With advancements in technology, we've identified new methods to enhance myViewBoard's speed and reliability. To achieve this, we rebuilt it entirely from the ground up on a new platform. 
  

This update also ensures that we have an easier time updating and adding amazing features.
  

Do I need to resync my users? 
No, all accounts will transition to the new myViewBoard without any changes on your side.
  

Do I need training? 
To support your transition, we’ve developed a variety of resources—including this comprehensive guide, refreshed YouTube tutorials, and webinars you can register for. If you're interested in onsite professional development, our dedicated training team is here to assist. Don’t hesitate to reach out!
  

Will my original OLF teaching materials stop working after the update? 
No worries! The new myViewBoard fully supports existing `.OLF` lesson files. You can even open multiple OLF files simultaneously, making it easier to manage your teaching content. Simply open your files as you normally would—no need to convert or recreate them.  
  

_Quick note: If you have very old or rare file types, there may be some compatibility issues. Please feel free to reach out—we have a support list available._
Will my account and settings disappear after upgrading? 
No. You can continue using your current account. The new version also supports syncing or manually setting up your frequently used tools, pen colors, and preferences, helping you get started quickly.
If I have both versions installed, how can I tell the icons apart? 
  * **Windows:** The new version of myViewBoard is installed as a new application. It retains the current logo with a white background and colorful border. The older version will switch to a yellow cloud icon for easier identification.  
  

  * **Android/iOS:** The app is directly updated, so you won't have both versions installed at the same time.  



✅ _Tip: With the updated icon, you'll easily recognize v3 on your desktop and avoid clicking the wrong one!_
Can I log in to both versions at the same time? 
We recommend logging into only one version at a time to ensure smooth data syncing and avoid conflicts or delays during operation.
Can my ViewBoard (IFP) support the version upgrade? 
Most models released after 2021 support OTA upgrades to the new version. Older models (e.g., those before the IFP50-3 series) may not be compatible due to memory limitations and will continue using the legacy version without impacting your teaching experience. Want to check if your device is supported? Please refer to the following compatibility list: 
  * [myViewBoard IFP compatibility](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/myviewboard-v3_ifp-compatibility)


How do I open a .olf file if I have both myViewBoard for Windows 2.0 and 3.0 installed? 
When you click a .olf file from your device, your system displays a system prompt window asking you to choose the version of myViewBoard for Windows you want to use. Both myViewBoard for Windows 2.0 and myViewBoard for Windows 3.0 are capable of handling .olf files. If you want to experience the latest features, improved performance, and new UI, select myViewBoard for Windows 3.0. It also supports .olf files created from the classic 2.0 version. Optionally, check "Always use this app" if you want to set a specific version as the default.
  

  

## 🙈 Content filtering
  

How does embedded browser and YouTube content filtering work? 
myViewBoard’s built-in YouTube player uses **YouTube SafeSearch** to filter video content, similar to YouTube’s Restricted Mode. This helps schools and educational institutions ensure that students only access appropriate and safe content during lessons. 
  

Additionally, myViewBoard has implemented a **Bad word list** mechanism to further prevent inappropriate searches. If a search query contains restricted keywords, the system will display default search results instead of showing content related to the original query.
  

What security rules are applied in YouTube filtering mechanism? 
  * **YouTube SafeSearch Mode** : Similar to YouTube’s Restricted Mode, filtering out content that is inappropriate for children and educational settings.  
  

  * **Bad Word List Mechanism** : If a search query contains certain restricted words, the system will return default results instead of relevant content. The restricted word list includes, but is not limited to:   
  
"sex", "porn", "adult", "nude", "naked", "xxx", "strip", "erotic", "fetish", "hard".   
  
For a full list, please contact the technical support team.  
  



Does the embedded browser have similar content filtering? 
Since this FAQ mainly focuses on YouTube's embedded player, the filtering mechanism for the embedded browser requires a separate discussion. For more information, please contact ViewSonic's technical support team to obtain detailed security and administrative control information for the myViewBoard browser.  
  

Can administrators modify or customize the filtering mechanism? 
Currently, myViewBoard uses a built-in YouTube SafeSearch filtering mode and bad word list mechanism, but there is no option for administrators to customize the filtering settings. If schools or IT administrators require stricter content control, they are advised to use additional network filtering solutions (such as school firewall or web filtering services).
  

Can these mechanisms completely prevent inappropriate content? 
While YouTube SafeSearch and the bad word list mechanism significantly reduce the likelihood of inappropriate content appearing, false positives or omissions may still occur. Teachers and IT administrators are encouraged to regularly monitor usage to ensure compliance with their institution's digital security policies.
  

How can users report inappropriate content? 
If users encounter inappropriate content in myViewBoard’s embedded YouTube player or browser, they can report it through the following methods:
  * Contact ViewSonic technical support with specific search keywords or URLs to help the team assess and improve filtering rules if needed.
  * Use YouTube’s built-in reporting feature to flag inappropriate videos or channels for review and action by YouTube.
