### **ViewSonic Manager™ FREE Software Features**
ViewSonic Manager is our free software that comes with compatible ViewSonic® displays.  
It’s perfect for handling all the essentials of your IT team.
**Urgent Alert CAP Messaging  
** Send urgent notifications across the campus quickly. By integrating with school alert systems via third-party Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) messaging, Manager helps keep your campus informed.
**Remote Commands**  
Handle everything from one place. You can turn devices on or off, adjust the volume, lock screens, and push software updates without ever leaving your desk.
**App Management**  
Create a consistent experience for everyone. Easily hide or show certain apps to make sure every device has the right set of tools for your school or district.
**Easy Device Enrollment**  
Quickly add devices with a PIN, serial number, or QR code. Need to set up many at once? Batch enrollment makes mass setup simple.
**Cloud-Based Access**  
Remotely access and manage devices from anywhere, with no software installation needed. All you need is a web browser and a myViewBoard® account.
### **ViewSonic Manager Advanced™  
UPGRADED Software Features   
**
ViewSonic Manager Advanced is our upgraded, subscription-based software that unlocks even more powerful features for total device control.
Make Your IT Job a Whole Lot Easier
Spend less time running around and more time getting things done. Manager Advanced gives you the tools to handle tasks remotely and efficiently.
  * **Job Scheduling**  
Plan ahead and automate your day, or year! Schedule apps to launch or devices to power on and off at specific times. It saves time and keeps your campus running smoothly.
  * **Remote Desktop**  
Solve problems from anywhere. Need to troubleshoot a display in a classroom? Just access it remotely from your computer to diagnose and fix the issue in minutes.


Set Up Devices Your Way
Ensure every display on campus is consistent, secure, and ready for use. You have full control over what users can see and do.
  * **User Management**  
Decide who does what. You can give specific team members permission to schedule tasks or manage content, keeping your system organized and secure.
  * **ViewSonic Software Setup**  
Install and update ViewSonic apps from afar for faster and easier device management. For example, you can remotely change settings for AirSync and other ViewSonic software, right from your computer.


Multimedia Broadcast Across Campus
Need to get the word out fast? Send announcements using text, images, and videos to all your screens at once. You can broadcast them immediately or schedule them for the perfect time.
## **User Management**
A Permissions function allows you to assign role-based permissions and user access for various features and devices (device enrollment, media management, job creation, etc.). This allows you to **easily maintain and control the different panel needs of various administrators and staff** with a clearly defined set of permissions – the right users have the right access to the right devices.
## **Multimedia Broadcast**
**Remotely broadcast pictures or videos to enrolled devices in full screen or use zones to display multiple pieces of media at once**. This feature can be used for dedicated digital signage displays around campus (lunch menus, school branding), or sending messages to ViewBoard® displays in classrooms (bell schedules, school announcements and news).
## **Comprehensive Android™ EDLA Device Management**
Enhance EDLA device management and signage capability for schools with Google Admin Console 
ViewSonic Manager™ and Manager Advanced™ offer full support for [Android™ EDLA-certified devices](https://www.viewsonic.com/edu/edla-certified). **Designed to complement the Google Admin Console, Manager adds robust hardware control and digital signage capabilities to EDLA environments**. While Google Admin streamlines app and user management, Manager and Manager Advanced empowers IT teams with centralized control over display settings, device status, broadcasts, and more—delivering a complete solution for managing EDLA devices from both a software and hardware perspective.
In addition, IT admin can effectively manage EDLA devices via a number of powerful features such as:
**EDLA User Management**
With Manager Advanced licenses, you can add, delete, and manage EDLA device user profiles. Admins can also control user creation directly on the device.
**Profile Management**
Configure wireless network settings, device startup and shutdown, and device security settings using the New/Classic switch in the app list management sections.
**Ensure Use of District-Approved Apps**
Standardize apps across campus with the ability to hide or show Google Play and other non-teaching tools on your displays.
### Made for Android™ EDLA Devices
ViewSonic Manager™ and Manager Advanced™ offer full support for [Android™ EDLA-certified devices](https://www.viewsonic.com/edu/edla-certified). **Designed to complement the Google Admin Console, Manager adds robust hardware control and digital signage capabilities to EDLA environments.** While Google Admin streamlines app and user management, Manager and Manager Advanced empowers IT teams with centralized control over display settings, device status, broadcasts, and more—delivering a complete solution for managing EDLA devices from both a software and hardware perspective.
