# Messages
Use the Manager console to broadcast **messages** to one or more devices. 
  

## Broadcasting basics
There are two basic message types: 
  

  * **Standard messages**  
Send messages that appear as a banner at the top of device screens. Text messages can be dismissed by the device users.  
  

  * **Urgent messages**  
Send messages that take up the entire screen, with the option to add a **siren sound** to the message. Urgent messages can only be terminated from the Manager console.


  

  

When sending a broadcast, admins can customize the following:
  

  * **Duration of broadcast.**   
How long should the broadcast be displayed.
  * **If users can terminate the broadcast**.   
If unchecked, users can tap a button on the screen to end the broadcast.
  * **When to stop broadcasting**.   
Terminate the broadcast manually.


  

  

Broadcasting **media** (such as **images** , **videos** , media **playlists** , and **web pages**) is only possible for devices that have the Manager advance license assigned. For more information, see the article below:
  

  * [Advanced broadcasting with layouts](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/broadcasting/layouts)

  2. Select one or more devices in the list.

  4. Select a broadcast type.

    1. **Standard**
    2. **Urgent**  
  

  6. Add the message to broadcast. 
  7. Select the broadcast duration:

  8. For **Standard messages** only: (_Optional_)  
Select the **Forbid device user from stopping broadcast** option to prevent users from stopping the broadcast manually. If not checked, users can stop / hide / dismiss a broadcast from displaying on their device even if the **Continuous** or **C****ustom** duration was set.   
  

  9. Click **OK** to start the broadcast.

       * **Duration**. Message stops after a specific length of time has passed.
       * **Expiration**. Message stops at a specific date and time.  
  

    2. **Continue broadcast when device is online**.
