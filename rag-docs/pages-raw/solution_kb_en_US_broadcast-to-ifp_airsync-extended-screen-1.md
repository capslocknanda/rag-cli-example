# Extended screen
AirSync allows users to use the IFP as an extended screen. This feature simulates a virtual screen that the OS treats as an extra monitor attached to the system. You can move windows and applications you want to share to this 'monitor'. Note that this feature is only available for the following versions:
  

  * AirSync Sender for Windows 
  * AirSync Sender for macOS (portable version)


  

  

## Use with Presenter View
To present a PowerPoint presentation in full screen on the IFP _and_ keep your notes visible on your device, use AirSync's screen extension with PowerPoint's **Presenter View** feature.
  

  1. Share your screen via the Windows or macOS (non-PWA version) sender's Screen extension feature.
  2. Open your PowerPoint presentation.  
  

  3. Go to the **Slide Show** tab. 
    1. Check the box for **Use Presenter View**.
    2. On the **Display** dropdown, select the extended display.  
  

  4. Confirm the setting.


  

Now, start your slide show and go to PowerPoint's **Presenter View**. The presentation content will be displayed on the IFP, while the current slide, next slide, and speaker notes will be on your main screen. To see this process in action, see the video below:

## Present with Web sender
To present a PowerPoint presentation in full screen when sharing as an application in the web sender, perform the following:
  

  1. Open your PowerPoint presentation.
  2. Start the PowerPoint presentation.
  3. Go to the AirSync web sender and connect to AirSync.
  4. When prompted for an application to share, select the active **Slide Show** presentation from the **Application** tab.


  

The PowerPoint content appears full-screen on the IFP.
