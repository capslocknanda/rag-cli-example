# Request an entity account

  * Access to the Entity Management console which offers centralized control to manage users, settings, and ViewSonic devices.
  * Support for different user roles: Entity Owner, Entity Admin, and Standard Users --each with specific access levels.
  * Access to advanced professional development and training opportunities.


  

For more details about these benefits, see the article below:

     * [ViewSonic Contact page](https://www.viewsonic.com/global/contact/)  
  

  2. Fill out the requested details: 
    1. Fields marked with a **red asterisk** (*) are required. 
    2. Since your inquiry is not related to a product unit: 
       * Please enter SN-0000 as the **Serial Number**
       * Please enter XXX as the **Model Name**   
  

  3. In the **Your Inquiry** text box, specify that your organization would like to sign up for an entity account.
  4. Click **Submit**. You will receive an automated email confirming your request has been received.


  

Expect a reply from a ViewSonic representative (located near your region) within 72 hours to confirm application details and kick off the entity creation process.
  

  

## Entity Request Form
Once your regional representative moves you to the next step, you will receive an email containing a link to the Entity Request Form. Ensure that you provide the appropriate selection for the following:
  * **[Entity roles](https://www.viewsonic.com/entity-setup/user-roles)**  
Specify users who will be assigned the **Entity Owner** and **Entity Admin** roles, including their contact information.   
  

  * **[Entity type](https://www.viewsonic.com/entity-setup/entity-type-breakdown)**  
Select your target **entity type** , based on the domain used by your entity.


  

Once the form has been submitted, a representative will review the request. 
  

**FORM EXPIRATION DATE**
The email containing the link to the form will include a _form expiration date_. You must complete the form before the expiration date. If the form link has already expired, you will need to contact your representative to request another form.
