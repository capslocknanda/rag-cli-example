# Assign administrators
Grant select users in your entity the necessary permissions to use Manager. Once these users are granted access, they will gain access to Manager features that will allow them to manage all registered devices in the entity. 
  

  

## Classic method
Access control to Manager was managed via myViewBoard Entity Management.
  

Procedure
In the previous version, admins performed the following steps:  
  

  1. Navigate to myViewBoard Entity Management page.
  2. Change a user’s role from **User** to **Admin**.
  3. User gained Manager access based on the updated role.


  

**Deprecated**
This method is no longer supported. Changing roles in myViewBoard Entity Management **will no longer affect** Manager access permissions. This method is presented for reference only. 
  

  

## Current method
To grant permission to users, follow the steps below: 
  

  1. Launch **Manager**. 
  2. Click **Settings** on the top bar.
  3. Click **Permissions** from the dropdown.  
  

  4. On the next page, perform the following to grant permissions:
    1. Click the **Add** icon in the upper-right corner.
    2. Select one or more users from the entity’s user list *. 
    3. Click **Confirm** to grant Manager access.  

  5. The selected user(s) should now appear in the list.


  

  

## Permissions page
## Grant access
  

  

Afterwards, verify that the user:
  * Can launch Manager via the Manager tile on the ViewSonic dashboard. 
  * Can access Manager and use its features. 


  

  

**Warning**
Note that the ability to grant or remove permissions is available to all Manager users. If you want to specify detailed permissions for each user, you will require a **Manager Advanced** license.
  

  

## About the user list
* A few important details about the user list:   
  

  * The user list is populated based on data from the ViewSonic Entity portal:   
  

    * <https://cloud.viewsonic.com/entity/home>

  

  * Access to Manager can only be assigned to users who belong to the entity. No external accounts are permitted. 
  * To add new users, admins would need to go to the ViewSonic Entity portal. For more detailed steps, refer to the article below:  
  

    * [ViewSonic Entity account - Users](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/vse-users)


  

  

## Remove access
To remove a user's access to Manager, perform the following
  

  1. Launch **Manager**. 
  2. Click **Settings** on the top bar.
  3. Click **Permissions** from the dropdown.  
  

  4. On the next page, locate the row of the user to remove.
    1. Hover over this row to show icons at the end.
    2. Click the **Delete** icon.  
  

  5. The user should no longer appear in the list.


  

  

  

## Migration impact on entities
With the migration of entities from myViewBoard to the ViewSonic Account and the Manager Q2 release, the Manager user-list workflow has been updated. For newly created entities, admins should note the following change: 
  

  

  * **Default Access** : After creation, only the Entity Owner has Manager access by default.
  * **Onboarding Requirement** : The Entity Owner must log in to Manager to assign its first users.
  * **Immutable Entry** : The Entity Owner cannot be removed from the Manager user list.
