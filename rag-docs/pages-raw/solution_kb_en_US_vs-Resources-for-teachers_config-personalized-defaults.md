# Personalized defaults
If you use multiple devices to present your lessons throughout the day, use the myViewBoard settings page to set up default preferences. Note the following information:
  

  * This requires a ViewSonic account. To create a ViewSonic account, refer to the following article:  
  

    * [Sign up to myViewBoard](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/3232975)  
  

  * Once set, your preferences will automatically load on any device when you sign in, and ensures that you can start teaching with the same set of preferences on any device.
  * Note that you can only be logged in into one device. Logging in to another device will auto-log you out of all other devices.

  3. Go to the **myViewBoard** tile: 
    1. Click the ellipsis to show the menu.
    2. Click **myViewBoard settings**.


  

The myViewBoard Settings page should open. 
  

## Customize session settings

  * Save responses, screenshots, and discussions generated during your lessons for review later
  * Set default images for specific myViewBoard features
