# Download ClassSwift
#### Once your setup in the ClassSwift Hub is complete, download the ClassSwift App to: 
  * Launch interactive lesson delivery. 
  * Use engagement tools such as polls, quizzes, and real-time Q&A to involve students and check for understanding. 


Choose your download option:
  *     * If myViewBoard v3 is installed → only ClassSwift will be added. 
    * If neither is installed → both apps will be installed.
