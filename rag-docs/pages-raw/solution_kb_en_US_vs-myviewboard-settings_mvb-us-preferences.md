# Preferences
Use this page to customize selected settings that are loaded when you sign-in with your account. 
  

  

  

## myViewBoard name
The myViewBoard name acts as your Session ID in myViewBoard or Classroom. By default, this will be the email used during sign up. We recommend you update this field to make it easier for your audience to join your session. The name will be used in the following apps:  
  

  * myViewBoard
  * Classroom
  * Companion


  

Note that spaces are not allowed in your myViewBoard name. Only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and symbols (_@-. only) are allowed.
  

  

## Custom Preferences 
When you use your ViewSonic account to sign in to a myViewBoard session, any customization you have specified here will apply during the entirety of your session. 
  

  

**Theme**. 
Change the theme loaded during your myViewBoard session. Options include:
  * Default - Loads your most recent setting.
  * Light - Always load the light theme
  * Dark - Always load the dark theme


  

  

**General Settings**. 
Specify how you want myViewBoard to behave during your session. By default, all these settings are turned off.
  * **Session password.**  
Require participants to enter a passcode to join your myViewBoard and myViewBoard Classroom sessions.
  * **Display time and date in myViewBoard.**  
Display the current date and time on the top-right of the canvas in myViewBoard. This can also be enabled from the [background menu](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/create-lessons/background-management?from_search=104073661).
  * **Display grid on myViewBoard canvas.**  
Overlay a grid over the myViewBoard canvas.
  * **Enable Wireless Presentation at startup.**  
Auto-start [Wireless Presentation](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/present-lessons/wireless-presentation) after signing in myViewBoard.
  * **Auto sign-out time.**  
Set how long myViewBoard is idle before it automatically signs you out of your session.  _For entity users:_ The sign-out time specified in [Software Instances](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/entity-management-1/software-instances#configure-an-instances-settings-6) will take precedence over the time you set here.


  

  

**Pen settings.**
Set how each tip of the ViewSonic pen renders drawn lines. Note that for width, a value of 1 indicates the thinnest and 10 is the widest. You can customize the following properties:
  * Thin tip width - Default is 1
  * Thin tip color - Default is black
  * Thick tip width - Default is 6
  * Thick tip color - Default is red


**Font settings**. 
Set custom properties of the text tool in myViewBoard.
  * Size - default is 44
  * Style - by default, nothing is selected
  * Color - default is black


  

To apply your changes, click **Save**.
  

[Delete](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/vs-myviewboard-settings/mvb-us-preferences)
**Important**
Always click **Save** after making changes. If you leave this page without clicking **Save** , the system will discard any updates you make.
  

  

## Set a session password
For added security, set a _session password_ to require students to type a password when [joining a myViewBoard](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/classroom-engagement/share-whiteboard-session) or myViewBoard Classroom session. Students using the [myViewBoard Companion app](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/companion-and-whiteboard/join-whiteboard-session), [Whiteboard Portal](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/other-resources/whiteboard-portal), or the Classroom student portal must provide this password to successfully join the session. 
  

The session password is randomly generated during the session. This ensures that only authorized students can join the session.
  

To set up a session password, follow these steps:  
  

  1. Go to **myViewBoard** section in **Settings**.
  2. Navigate to **Preference > General Settings.**
  3. Set the **Session password** toggle to ON.
  4. Click **Save**.  
  

  5. To verify:
    1. Start a new myViewBoard session. 
    2. [Share the session from within myViewBoard](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/classroom-engagement/share-whiteboard-session#inviting-when-session-password-is-enabled-2). 
    3. In the share session popup window, note the password displayed above the QR code.
