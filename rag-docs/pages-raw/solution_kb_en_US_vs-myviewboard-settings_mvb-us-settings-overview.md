Customize session behavior when your myViewBoard account is loaded.   
---|---

Specify a custom background image loaded after you sign in. Also allows you to specify additional images available for this feature during your session.  
_auto_fix_high_ |  [**Magic Line Pen**](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/3184127)  
Specify a custom image assigned to the Magic Line Pen after you sign in. Also allows you to specify additional images available for this feature during your session.  
_approval_ |  [**Shape Pen**](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/3184128)
