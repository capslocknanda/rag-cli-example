# Layouts
Specify a **Layout** that defines the placement of your selected media during a broadcast. Users can switch between landscape and portrait options. If no layout is selected, Manager defaults to showing only one media which takes up the full screen during the broadcast.
  

Advanced license required
This feature is only available for devices assigned with an Advanced license. For more information, see the articles below: 
  * [Manager Advance license overview](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/overview-manager-advanced)
  * [Assign Advanced license to devices](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/get-advanced-licenses)

## Select a layout
To select a broadcast layout, perform the following:
  

  1. Go to the **All Devices** page.
  2. Select one or more devices in the list.   
Selected devices must all have an **Advanced license** assigned.  
  

  3. Click the **Broadcast****Broadcast** popup.  
  

  4. Click **Media Content** as the **Broadcast Type**.   
The Media content option is only available if all selected devices have an **Advanced license** assigned.  
  

  5. Note the **Layout** options at the bottom of the preview:
    1. Select a **Layout**.   
By default, all options here are for **Landscape** mode.   
Click **Portrait** mode to see options for vertical layouts.  
  

    2. Click **Add content** on the panel where the media should appear. Select an option from the dropdown menu. All layout sections support the insertion of multimedia (image, video, or audio), playlists, web pages, text, and presentations. 


  

  

  

Note the following behavior:
  * Any multimedia must be added to Manager first before you can use it here.
  * The default layout option supports broadcasting only one media content. Select this layout to have your chosen media take up the entire screen.
  * Aspect ratios for each section are fixed. Try to match image and video resolutions before hand to fit the sections you intend to insert them in. 


  

  

## Portrait mode
If you plan to broadcast in portrait mode: 
  * Before starting the broadcast, always verify that your target device has been physically rotated to the correct orientation, and has already been previously configured to present its display in **Portrait** mode. 
  * Portrait orientation is currently supported on the **CDE30** device.


  

  

## Start a broadcast
Once the selected media are inserted, perform the following to send the broadcast.
  

  1. Verify that all media have been added to the message to broadcast. 
  2. Select the broadcast duration:
     * **Continuous**. Displays the message until device users dismiss the broadcast, or a Manager admin stops the broadcast.
     * **Custom**. Sets a custom duration for the broadcast. Message is auto-dismissed once the duration has been reached.   
  

  3. (Optional) Select the **Forbid device user from stopping broadcast** option to prevent users from stopping the broadcast manually. If not checked, users can stop / hide / dismiss a broadcast from displaying on their device even if the **Continuous** or **Custom** duration was set.   
  

  4. Click **Confirm** to start the broadcast.
