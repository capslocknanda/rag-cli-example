##  [ School District Offers Esports to All Ages by Leveraging ViewSonic Display Infrastructure ](https://www.viewsonic.com/us/blog/school-district-offers-esports-to-all-ages-by-leveraging-viewsonic-display-infrastructure/)
  * Dec 23, 2025


**CASE STUDY**
### **School District Offers Esports to All Ages by Leveraging ViewSonic Display Infrastructure**
### **PROFILE**
Fayette County Public Schools is a large district encompassing the city of Lexington, Kentucky and serving approximately 42,000 students across 57 schools. The second-largest school district in Kentucky, it includes 38 elementary schools, 13 middle schools and 6 high schools, along with preschools and several additional programs/technical centers, with a 60% minority enrollment and over a third of students whose families are economically disadvantaged.
“Just one plug is all it takes for the ViewSonic ViewBoard to launch an instant esports lounge. That single connection makes the display the unquestioned focal point—where any room is a ready-to-compete arena.”
* * *
— Shad Lacefield, FCPS STEM Learning Coach
### **CHALLENGE**
  * Establish the state’s first elementary school esports program to positively impact student success and engagement. 
  * Overcome the lack of dedicated space and budget to accommodate significant student interest. 
  * Find funding for career connection projects, such as producing student-designed team jerseys. 


Boasting several state championships, the Fayette County Public Schools (FCPS) high schools had enjoyed the benefits of a thriving esports program since 2019. In 2023, the principal of the G. W. Carver STEM Academy, Lamar Allen, set his sights on bringing these benefits to his students.
“He was determined to become the first elementary esports program in the state,” said Shad Lacefield, FCPS STEM Learning Coach, who provides tech support throughout the district and helps esport coordinators with program startup. “As the leader of a STEM school, he knew how much this program could positively impact student success.”
The most immediate challenge to establishing the program was finding the space and equipment to accommodate significant student interest. After that, program staff were challenged with how to fund projects designed to engage students in esports career connections.
### **SOLUTION**
  * Leveraged existing infrastructure of 75-inch ViewSonic® ViewBoard® interactive flat panel displays to create equitable access. 
  * Utilized mobile carts to create flexible “pop-up” esports lounges in shared spaces like libraries and media centers. 
  * Deployed the ViewSonic All- in-One Direct View LED mobile and foldable display for large- scale competitions and events. 
  * Partnered with ViewSonic to cover production costs for team jerseys. 


In the five years preceding the dream of an all-ages esports program, FCPS had installed 75-inch ViewSonic ViewBoard interactive flat panel displays in every classroom in order to create a universal classroom experience and equitable environment for student learning across the district. These existing displays, Lacefield realized, could be leveraged to support the elementary esports expansion.
“The ViewSonic IFP displays bring outstanding interactivity and engagement to classroom learning,” said Lacefield. “It was a tremendous investment in our students that we were able to extend as a shared resource to create popup esports lounges. This solved the universal problems of one, how to afford the equipment, and two, where are we going to put it.”
The inaugural club was launched in the G. W. Carver STEM Academy library, which housed a media space ripe for conversion into a part-time esports environment.
“There were several ViewSonic IFP displays already in the room, which serves as a flexible learning space for students, and the school had other ViewSonic ViewBoard displays on mobile carts,” said Lacefield. “It was easy to simply roll them in for the after-school club meetings.”
And with that, mission accomplished: FCPS had the first-ever elementary esports lounge in the state. Next, the team found exciting ways to leverage another ViewSonic display resource: an all-in-one mobile Direct View LED Display folding travel kit.
“The district purchased it for use in large spaces like the auditoriums where we hold conferences and professional development programs,” said Lacefield. “Of course, it also shines as a focal point at in-person esports competitions, where we’re able to display four screens at a time on the one massive display.”
Ultimately, the district was able to provide the after-school club at no cost to participants, thanks to existing infrastructure and support from grants and partnerships. However, when students designed team logos and jerseys, the club had no funds to produce them.
“The project would have had to remain a creative exercise,” said Lacefield, “But ViewSonic stepped in and covered the cost of every jersey for every player.”
### **RESULTS**
  * Rapid program expansion from a single pilot school to 41 schools (30 elementary and 11 middle) in just two years. 
  * Created a cost-free, inclusive extracurricular activity that improves social-emotional and academic outcomes. 
  * Maximized hardware investment by using displays for instruction during the day and gaming after school. 
  * Fast setup allowed staff to launch an esports arena instantly with just one plug. 
  * Developed a strong pipeline of enthusiastic students and supportive parents feeding into high school esports programs. 


What started with one school quickly exploded to thirty in the span of just two years. By the 2025-2026 school year, spaces in 30 elementary and 11 middle schools were being used for the after-school esports program – with more to come. At one school, the club used a conference room already outfitted with 75-inch ViewSonic ViewBoard IFP displays. At another, the maker space was a perfect fit. Each school was unique, but all made use of existing wall- or mobile cart-mounted ViewSonic ViewBoard displays. 
“The ViewSonic cart-mounted displays offer incredible flexibility of use,” said Lacefield. “They can be moved during the day to meet instructional needs, and used after school to support extracurriculars.” 
To easily facilitate the transformations, Lacefield created gamer backpacks that house everything needed for the students to connect to and use the displays. 
“Once the IFP displays are wheeled in, the students can set up the gaming space quickly and easily,” said Lacefield. “Just one plug is all it takes for the ViewSonic ViewBoard IFP to launch an instant esports lounge. That single connection makes the display the unquestioned focal point—where any room is a ready-to-compete arena.” 
In all cases, the results were exciting and impactful. 
“The kids absolutely love playing on what to them looks like massive TV screens,” said Lacefield. “And the video quality and speed are incredible – even when running a LAN tournament. The huge screens make it feel so exciting and real to the kids.” 
Within a year, the program Lacefield managed merged with the Girls Who Game club, led by Ashley Faulkner. Together they became EPIC Esports and began creating curriculum around the esports industry and other important gaming topics. 
“We realized that we were teaching students how to be digital citizens online with their Chromebooks, but not necessarily through gaming. To gain insight, we surveyed a sample of students from across the district,” said Lacefield. “We discovered that 90% were gaming weekly, with 79% engaging with people they didn’t know. To address this, we created content for students and parents on how to safely navigate this ecosystem.” 
Along with gathering to game, members of the EPIC Esports program learn about the inner workings of the esports industry and its career opportunities. 
“We’re showing our students that, while they may not end up pro gamers, their love of video games could lead them down related career paths,” said Lacefield. “They could become game designers, shout casters, graphic designers, and more.” 
To bring these opportunities to life, Lacefield and Faulkner engage students in career connection activities like designing team logos and jerseys. 
“Thanks to ViewSonic we were able to produce and provide jerseys with student-designed logos for all of our teams,” said Lacefield. “We are so grateful to them for their support.” 
The club’s name, which stands for Engaging Players in Inclusive Competitions, epitomizes its impact on students. At its heart, the FCPS EPIC Esports Club is about engagement. Research has consistently demonstrated that students who participate in extracurricular activities thrive. In every way, involved students do better: academically, socially-emotionally, and in their lives beyond school. 
“Most of our esports students weren’t involved in any other extracurricular activities; this club was their first,” said Lacefield. “Now they’re making new friends and expanding their experiences, and the impact on student growth is amazing.” 
A district middle school exemplifies this impact. 
“These kids have been extremely successful in our region, which includes teams from Florida up through New York,” said Lacefield. “They were in the top five out of 170 teams in a recent competition. Later their coach told us that she saw a big change in students’ behavior and demeanor in school. It gave them a boost of confidence to be one of the best Super Smash teams in the region.” 
Coaches at other schools have shared similar feedback, from students and parents. 
“A parent of one of my students got emotional during a meeting, while sharing how EPIC Esports helped her son find a place and make friends,” said Jennifer Reams, an Elementary EPIC Esports Coach, “This is a student who has a learning disability and struggles academically, but in esports he excelled, becoming one of our top Mario Kart racers.” 
Parental appreciation for the EPIC Esports program has impacted the pipeline to high school esports participation as well. 
“In the past, parents were often skeptical about their kids participating,” said Chris Griffith, Esports Coach at Esports State Champion Lafayette High School. “However this year, when I hosted the booth for our esports team at orientation, the middle school parents were thrilled to sign their kids up for our team. There were many students and families excited to continue what they started with EPIC Esports. That was really cool to me.” 
The EPIC Esports program has been an unequivocal success, said Lacefield, thanks to the help of partners like ViewSonic. 
“It’s been everything we’ve hoped for,” he said. “We have been able to provide a free, safe community where kids can make friends and do what they love, and we’ve seen the positive impact in improved academic and social-emotional outcomes.”

##  [ By Integrating ViewSonic Technology, Preuniversitario Gauss Redefines Pre-University Education in Chile ](https://www.viewsonic.com/us/blog/by-integrating-viewsonic-technology-preuniversitario-gauss-redefines-pre-university-education-in-chile/)
  * Dec 9, 2025


**CASE STUDY**
### **By Integrating ViewSonic Technology, Preuniversitario Gauss Redefines Pre-University Education in Chile**
### **PROFILE**
In Chile, a preuniversitario is a private educational institution that prepares high school students—typically in their final four years—for the Higher Education Admission Test (PAES), a critical exam for university admission. 
Founded in 2011, Preuniversitario Gauss was established with a clear mission: to prepare students for higher education through a model rooted in academic excellence. With more than 15 years of experience, Gauss now operates seven physical campuses—Los Trapenses, Chamisero, La Reina, Huechuraba, Peñalolén, Montemar, and La Serena—alongside a robust online campus. This expansion has positioned the institution as one of Chile’s most innovative and forward-thinking pre-university programs. 
In 2019, Cathia Morais joined Gauss as Business Development Manager with a bold vision to elevate the institution. “My mission was to lead a digital transformation and turn Preu Gauss into a five-star pre-university institution, where academic excellence and technology go hand in hand,” she recalls. 
Since the arrival of Morais, Gauss has focused on delivering an academic experience defined by excellence, innovation, and outstanding service—setting a new benchmark for pre-university education in Chile.
“Thanks to the swift execution by our distributor and the dedicated support of the after-sales training team, we implemented the technology in record time. Since then, we’ve become the first pre-university institution in Chile—and likely the first educational institution overall—to equip every classroom on every campus with interactive screens.”
* * *
— Cathia Morais, Business Development Manager
### **CHALLENGE**
  * Redesign the conventional education framework, replacing outdated tools like blackboards, projectors, and notebooks with a comprehensive digital approach. 
  * Position Gauss Pre-University as a leading premium institution, recognized for its superior level of service. 
  * Maintain the delivery of online classes throughout the pandemic, while preserving the quality and personal connection of the learning experience. 


Since its establishment, Preuniversitario Gauss has aimed to distinguish itself from traditional pre-university institutions in Chile. From the outset, the institution recognized the growing need for a digital learning model—one that would enable students to attend classes from anywhere. “We already saw the need for a digital transformation that would allow us to reach students throughout Chile,” recalls Morais.
The leadership team understood that the future of education lay in hybrid and connected learning, a trend already evident in more advanced educational systems, such as those in the United States and Europe. Before embarking on its transformation, Gauss’s instructional approach mirrored that of most Chilean institutions: a traditional setup dependent on blackboards, projectors, and limited digital interaction.
“Everything was done manually—attendance, notes, exercises. Students had to be physically present to learn,” Morais explains. While this model had served its purpose, it offered little flexibility and left minimal room for innovation.
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically accelerated the institution’s digital strategy. Almost overnight, Gauss was faced with a dual challenge: to establish itself as a premium pre-university institution while also ensuring continuity of learning during lockdowns. “We had two challenges,” says Morais. “We wanted to differentiate ourselves as a premium pre-university institution with a higher standard of service, and at the same time, ensure that all students could continue learning—even if they couldn’t attend in person.”
The greatest hurdle was delivering the same level of quality and personal connection students experienced in physical classrooms through a fully online or hybrid format. What had once been a long-term digital vision became an urgent operational priority. With the pandemic, we told ourselves: this is the moment— we have to invest in putting screens in every classroom,” Morais concludes.
### **SOLUTION**
  * Implemented 42 ViewBoard® IFP6550 interactive displays across all classrooms. 
  * Adopted the myViewBoard® ecosystem for managing classroom content, digital materials, and attendance tracking. 
  * Transitioned to a hybrid and online learning model, making classes accessible to students across Chile. 


Preuniversitario Gauss’s technological journey began in 2018 with the acquisition of its first ViewSonic® ViewBoard® interactive display. Though initially dependent on an external computer, this first device offered an early glimpse into the tool’s potential. Shortly after launching its digital transformation strategy, Gauss outlined a more ambitious plan to modernize its academic model. The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic served as a powerful catalyst, accelerating that plan and prompting the rapid, simultaneous rollout of interactive displays across all campuses. 
The project advanced with remarkable speed. Backed by distributor LACE Educación and supported by ViewSonic’s after-sales and training teams, Gauss successfully equipped every classroom in just two weeks. 
“Thanks to our distributor’s rapid execution and the after-sales training team, we were able to implement the technology in record time. Since then, we’ve been the first pre-university—and likely the first educational institution—in Chile to have interactive screens in every classroom and on every campus,” explains Morais. 
Today, 42 ViewBoard IFP6550 interactive displays form part of Gauss’s core educational infrastructure. Each 65-inch screen is integrated with cameras, microphones, and myViewBoard software, enabling seamless, real-time hybrid classes enriched with dynamic digital resources. “Teachers can annotate documents, grade essays directly on screen, or play YouTube videos to illustrate concepts. It makes teaching far more interactive and visual,” Morais adds. 
Beyond enhancing classroom learning, the technology has also been adopted to improve internal operations—for example, during enrollment sessions, when staff use the interactive displays to present services and deliver live demonstrations of the Gauss experience to prospective families. 
### **RESULTS**
  * Ensured uninterrupted learning and rapid adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  * Achieved greater classroom interaction, engagement, and student motivation. 
  * Strengthened Preuniversitario Gauss’s position as a leading, technology-driven institution in Chile’s education sector. 


The implementation of ViewSonic interactive displays marked a defining milestone in the evolution of Preuniversitario Gauss. For students, it ensured uninterrupted academic preparation—regardless of external circumstances. “Students can log in from home if they’re sick or traveling and still participate in class as if they were physically there,” explains Morais, highlighting the immersive nature of the hybrid experience. 
For teachers, the impact was equally transformative. “It was revolutionary. Teachers now have tools that make their classes more dynamic,” she adds. The new technology introduced interactive learning capabilities through videos, 3D graphics, and digital presentations—significantly improving both teaching quality and student engagement. 
The benefits extended beyond the classroom. The use of cutting-edge technology quickly became a key differentiator for Gauss in the education market. “When we show our classes live on screen, parents instantly recognize the innovation and professionalism. It’s a decisive factor in their choice,” Morais notes. As a result, technological innovation has become central to Gauss’s identity as a premium institution. 
Even after five years of active use, Gauss continues to push forward. The institution regularly explores new features within myViewBoard, keeps its equipment up to date, and ensures ongoing teacher training. At the start of each academic year, educators participate in refresher sessions to maximize the effective use of technology in their classrooms. 
Looking ahead, Preuniversitario Gauss plans to integrate artificial intelligence and more advanced interactive tools to further enhance the student learning experience. “We are incredibly proud. This transformation didn’t just change how we teach—it solidified Gauss’s reputation as a premium institution,” concludes Morais.

##  [ A Guide to Direct View LED Power Requirements ](https://www.viewsonic.com/us/blog/a-guide-to-direct-view-led-power-requirements/)
  * Oct 14, 2025


So, you’re getting a massive, brilliant Direct View LED video wall. That’s awesome! But let’s talk about the one thing that can stop your project cold: power.
Modern Direct View LED displays are more efficient than ever, but they still need serious juice. Planning for power isn’t just a final step; it’s the foundation of a great installation.
**Why Power Planning for Direct View LED Can’t Be an Afterthought**
These displays often need special 20A or 30A circuits, which aren’t your everyday outlets. That means you’ll probably need an electrician to install dedicated power lines. Get this sorted out early, and you’ll avoid some major headaches on installation day.
**Your Quick Power Checklist**
During your site walk, grab your electrician and figure these things out. Answering these questions now will save you a ton of time and money.
  * **What kind of circuit do we need?** Check the specs. Does the display need 20A or 30A circuits, and how many?
  * **Is the breaker box ready?** Make sure the building’s electrical panel can handle the extra load without any issues.
  * **Where do the outlets go?** Pinpoint the exact location for the outlets. You’ll likely want them recessed so your display sits perfectly flat against the wall.


**The Payoff of Proper Planning**
Coordinating with an electrician, securing permits, and preparing the site can take time. Addressing these needs early helps you avoid unexpected costs and delays. Strategic power planning doesn’t just enable a smooth installation, but it ensures optimal performance, safety, and longevity for your display
**Ready to bring your vision to life? Explore[ViewSonic Direct View LED solutions](https://www.viewsonic.com/business/led-displays) and ensure your project is a brilliant success from start to finish.**
*Actual performance, installation requirements, and results may vary depending on system configuration, building infrastructure, and usage environment.

##  [ Want a Perfect DIRECT VIEW LED Install? Start Here. ](https://www.viewsonic.com/us/blog/want-a-perfect-direct-view-led-install-start-here/)
  * Oct 13, 2025


The key to a flawless Direct View LED installation isn’t just about the hardware. It’s all in the prep work. Trust us, a little planning now saves a world of stress later.
Before you even think about unboxing those panels, use this checklist to make sure you’re ready for a smooth, fast, and impressive install.
**Nail Down the Basics First**
Get these details locked in during the design phase. It’s so much easier to make a change on paper than it is on a half-finished wall.
  * Location, Location, Location: Picking the perfect spot is about more than just the audience’s view. Does the location have enough space for power and cabling? Look for obstructions like fire alarms or thermostats that might need to be moved. Also, think about the installation itself. Will your team need special equipment like a lift to access the area safely? Make sure the spot works for everyone.
  * Know Your Wall: The wall’s material changes everything. Drywall often needs shimming to be perfectly flat and can settle over time without proper backing, which can cause ugly gaps. For tougher surfaces like brick or concrete, you’ll need to plan exactly how and where the mounting structures and cables will be placed. Getting this right now prevents costly delays later.
  * Make Sure it Will Hold: While today’s Direct View LED displays are lighter than older videowalls, they are still heavy and need proper support. Never underestimate the weight. Adding extra backing, like a sheet of plywood, is a simple way to give the wall more than enough strength to hold the display securely for years to come.


It all comes down to that old saying: “measure twice, cut once.” In the world of Direct View LED, great planning is what turns a good install into a stunning one.
**Feeling confident and ready for the next step? Explore[ViewSonic Direct View LED solutions](https://www.viewsonic.com/business/led-displays) to see what can be a good fit for your space.**
*Actual installation requirements, performance, and durability may vary depending on wall structure, site conditions, and system configuration. Professional installation is recommended.

##  [ Excelling in Connectivity with ViewSonic ViewBoard Interactive Displays ](https://www.viewsonic.com/us/blog/excelling-in-connectivity-with-viewsonic-viewboard-interactive-displays/)
  * Aug 26, 2025


**SOLUTION BRIEF**
### **Excelling in Connectivity with ViewSonic ® ViewBoard® Interactive Displays**
### **BACKGROUND**
For one school district located in western Canada representing a large and diverse network of K-12 public schools, raising the bar of excellence for digital learning was achieved with ViewSonic’s ViewBoard solution.
“ViewSonic’s myViewBoard platform enables real-time collaboration from any location, with cloud-based portability, screen mirroring/sharing and digital whiteboarding supporting a variety of pedagogies over an open, agnostic, and secure platform.
* * *
— Miles Brandon, Owner, Capistrano VW
### **CHALLENGE**
  * Equipment currently in use is beginning to reach the end of their service life 


As part of its education delivery, the district had previously relied on Promethean projectors in classrooms, but these products were reaching the end of their life cycle. Not only were the images hard to see in ambient light conditions, the systems often needed replacement parts and were expensive to maintain. Additionally, the projectors had to be manually recalibrated every time they were moved, presenting new logistical challenges. The school district decided it was time to make a transition to newer technology, and undertook a comprehensive search and trial of leading visual technologies, from projection systems to interactive flat panel displays (IFPs) – including ViewSonic® ViewBoard® interactive displays.
The team leading the search already knew that interactive flat panel systems would be more flexible to use, much easier to install, and require less maintenance than projectors. They decided to invite teachers from across their network to a central location to evaluate four different interactive flat panel (IFP) display systems in person.
### **SOLUTION**
  * ViewBoard IFP8650 86-inch Interactive Display 
  * myViewBoard® Digital Whiteboarding Software 


ViewSonic’s ViewBoard interactive displays with integrated myViewBoard® whiteboarding software was the clear winner from the start. The decision was made to go with the 86-inch ViewSonic ViewBoard IFP8650 with integrated myViewBoard software as a standardized solution across their school system.
During the evaluation period, the teams that were leading the search noted that teachers tended to gather around the ViewBoard at the end of the day to get a first-hand trial of the myViewBoard system. It definitely caused the most excitement which made for a very easy decision.
One area of concern expressed by the teachers was ensuring seamless transition of the content they had accumulated over the years to the new system. Because myViewBoard software natively opens Promethean Flipchart files, teachers were able to easily import and manage all of their content created on older software. All of their content was accessible so they didn’t have to reinvent the wheel.
Teachers were also able to transition to the new technology with minimal interruption. The school district decided to install the new ViewBoard displays in schools during the school year, and were able to remove the old technology in the evening and install the ViewSonic system by the end of the next day.
### **RESULTS**
  * Stunning 231-inch seamless video wall transformed showroom aesthetics and energy 
  * Reliable all-in-one system resolved previous performance and management issues 
  * Easy setup with complete kit enabled quick, frustrationfree installation 
  * Day-and-night visibility extended promotional impact to freeway traffic 
  * Enhanced content flexibility for events, promotions, and employee recognition 
  * Long LED lifespan reduces maintenance and supports 24/7 use 
  * Dealership excited to expand usage for movie nights, community engagement, and brand storytelling 


“With such a mix of different schools and teaching styles, this school district had numerous different use cases for the technology,” said Deidre Deacon, General Manager, ViewSonic Canada. In choosing ViewSonic’s myViewBoard platform, flexibility was a key consideration. “The beauty of the ViewBoard solution is the ability to easily adapt to the curriculum of a particular school, while enabling centralized maintenance and control through the myViewBoard software. Another key advantage over the older projection systems is the improved contrast, which provides clearer images and better viewing angles.”
The ViewBoard displays are also capable of wireless connectivity which enables screen sharing from any laptop, allowing teachers and students to easily share content via their in-class devices.
Wireless connectivity and easy set up were critical considerations as the units could easily be moved between schools and maintained from a central location. Installation was quickly completed – in fact the rollout of the first 230 ViewSonic ViewBoard displays took only 12 weeks to complete.
Today, teachers are excited with what they can do with the new technology. They are also trying out different digital learning tools, like putting cameras on top of the ViewBoard displays, streaming school tournaments, and allowing multiple students to engage on the screen at the same time.
Having advanced interactive display technology has also been a valuable drawing card with parents who are always looking for what’s best for their kids. If they see more cutting-edge technology that actually works, and they know they can watch and be connected with their kids, the decision to send them to one of the district’s schools is easy.

##  [ Why Content Strategy Comes First in Video Wall Projects ](https://www.viewsonic.com/us/blog/why-content-strategy-comes-first-in-video-wall-projects/)
  * Aug 6, 2025


Video walls are powerful tools for communication, branding, and engagement—but only when they’re used with purpose. Too often, organizations and integrators focus on the hardware first, only to realize later that they haven’t planned what will actually go on the screen.
**For End Users: Think Beyond the Screen**
Before investing in a video wall, ask yourself:
  
**What do you want your audience to see, learn, or feel?**  
Without a clear content strategy, even the most advanced display can become an expensive slideshow of generic visuals. Planning your content early ensures your investment delivers real value—whether it’s driving sales, sharing information, or enhancing the environment.
**For Integrators: Guide the Conversation Early**
As an integrator, your role goes beyond installation. Helping clients define their content goals early in the process ensures the system you design supports their vision. That includes:
  * Matching resolution and aspect ratio to content needs
  * Ensuring signal distribution and playback systems are scalable
  * Planning for content updates and user-friendly control
  * Designing for serviceability and long-term performance


**The Bottom Line**
A video wall is only as effective as the content it displays. Whether you're the one using it or the one building it, start with the message. The technology should serve the story—not the other way around.

##  [ ViewSonic Revolutionizes Education in Costa Rica with ViewBoard® Interactive Displays ](https://www.viewsonic.com/us/blog/viewsonic-revolutionizes-education-in-costa-rica-with-viewboard-interactive-displays/)
  * Aug 5, 2025


**CASE STUDY**
### **ViewSonic Revolutionizes Education in Costa Rica with ViewBoard® Interactive Displays**
### **PROFILE**
The Diocesan Catholic Education Project (PRODIECA) is a Catholic organization composed of three educational centers in the province of Guanacaste, Costa Rica:
Centro Educativo Católico San Ambrosio (1994)

Centro Educativo Católico Vittorino Girardi Stellin (2014)
PRODIECA created its educational communities as a response to the educational crisis arising from challenges in forming meaningful educational relationships. For these relationships to be authentic, they must convey essential values and life principles that support each individual’s growth and maturity, while also contributing to the common good.
PRODIECA works to overcome the disconnect in traditional education by fostering authentic, value-based relationships that support personal growth and collective well-being. It also contributes to faith communities by promoting values aligned with peace, justice and humanity.
“The use and implementation of technological tools has had a positive impact, generating strong interest and motivation”.
* * *
— Rodolfo Araya Rojas, PRODIECA Principal

  * Acquire high-resolution displays with advanced features and minimal maintenance requirements
  * Provide students with access to interactive content, enabling seamless integration with their tablets
  * Implement operating systems compatible with all educational tools
  * Enhance student learning and attention through interactive, immersive experiences


Classroom instruction was outdated and limited to physical tools like chalkboards and printed worksheets. There was a critical need to modernize the teaching process through digital tools and more engaging methods.
One key challenge was the need to diversify classroom practices by incorporating technology into the teaching process.
This included integrating principles of Universal Design for Learning and gamification to enhance educational mediation. This need was one of the main factors that led PRODIECA to initiate the project.
Additionally, in subjects such as Mathematics and Physics, there was a specific need to create learning situations that promoted both graphical and algebraic analysis.
The project launched at the beginning of the 2024 school year focused on raising awareness about the use of new technological tools. This was followed by hands-on exploration and implementation in subject-specific areas, enabling teachers to integrate these tools into their mediation strategies based on their particular disciplines. 
### **SOLUTION**
  * Deployed 23 ViewBoard IFP8650 interactive displays across key classrooms
  * Seamlessly connected the displays with existing school systems for efficient operation
  * Activated myViewBoard PRO licenses for all entity accounts, maximizing interactive capabilities
  * Provided comprehensive teacher training to ensure effective utilization of the new technology


To support the project’s goal of diversifying classroom activities through the integration of innovative technological tools, the distributor SOINED not only provided the necessary equipment but also delivered comprehensive training to ensure its effective adoption and pedagogical integration. This training played a key role in strengthening both the use and educational application of the technology.
Previously reliant on standard whiteboards, PRODIECA recognized the need for transformation. In response, SOINED, committed to delivering forward-thinking educational solutions, arranged a demonstration. 
A thorough evaluation followed, leading to the selection of ViewSonic’s IFP52-2ED ViewBoard interactive displays —a solution that not only addresses current classroom needs but also significantly enhanced the overall educational experience.
The presentation —led by SOINED’s pedagogical and commercial teams—reinforced a shared commitment to innovation. It was followed by well-coordinated logistics for delivery, installation, and personalized teacher training, ensuring the technology was seamlessly implemented and fully utilized driven by a vision to transform education, a demonstration was promptly arranged, followed by a thorough evaluation that led to the selection of ViewSonic IFP52-EDLA ViewBoard interactive displays.
This solution not only meets the current needs of the schools but also significantly enhances the overall educational experience.
Significantly, this initiative marks the first time PRODIECA has incorporated ViewSonic equipment into its educational model. ViewSonic offers a comprehensive solution that combines cutting-edge technology with pedagogical innovation. Partnering with SOINED has further enhanced the value and effectiveness of the implementation.
The installation process was swift and precise, allowing both students and teachers to benefit from the new tools almost immediately. ViewSonic’s technology fostered collaborative learning and enabled interaction with 3D models, human anatomy, geographic data, and even traditional subjects such as mathematics.
### **RESULTS**
  * Students actively participate without fear of equipment damage
  * Streamlined IT resource management
  * Significant savings through energy-efficient technology
  * Alignment with ISO standards
  * Elevated satisfaction with the overall learning environment and a commitment to continuous improvement improvement


The installation of this equipment has allowed for greater diversification of classroom activities, enriching the teaching process through the integration of innovative and engaging resources.
Encouraged by the positive results, the organization plans to expand the use of this and other ViewSonic solutions in the future.
These tools have led to more efficient use of instructional time and have significantly boosted motivation among both students and teachers. This renewed enthusiasm is reflected in improved analytical thinking and other qualitatively assessed skills.

**CASE STUDY**
### **Car Dealership’s Creativity Shines Bright with Huge ViewSonic Direct View LED Display**
### **COMPANY**
In a city brimming with history, the Capistrano VW dealership is itself historic. Opened in 1963, seven years before San Juan Capistrano in Orange County, California became an official city, the dealership was the region’s first purveyor of new cars. In 1997 it was purchased by its current owner, Miles Brandon, who opened Capistrano Mazda next door in 2015. Today, both dealerships operate according to Brandon’s “undealer” philosophy, which strives to deliver a unique and positive experience that surpasses what customers and employees expect from a car dealer. Both dealerships have been recognized with award-winning customer service. 
““This incredible [Direct View LED display] addressed every issue we had with the other systems. It’s a complete package from one manufacturer, and it includes easy device management software. It’s absolutely beautiful, with no annoying bezels. And the price was good too, which really amazed me.”
* * *
— Miles Brandon, Owner, Capistrano VW
### **CHALLENGE**
  * Create a visually unique showroom experience within strict manufacturer branding constraints 
  * Replace failing multi-screen video wall with a more reliable, easier-to-manage solution 
  * Eliminate frequent maintenance costs and performance issues caused by complex multi-vendor setup 


Car dealerships are notoriously homogenous within each brand, with manufacturers dictating virtually every aspect of the design, inside and out. This leaves owners with limited opportunity to visually distinguish themselves. Nonetheless, Brandon – who is as enthusiastic about his showroom’s appeal as he is about the history of Volkswagen vehicles – has managed to implement unique and successful strategies over his many years in the business.
“In 2012, we followed the lead of Casey Gunther, then the top VW dealer in the U.S., who broke all the rules and created amazing energy in his Florida showroom,” said Brandon. “He took it pretty far, with things like vibrant hood artwork on the vehicles in his showroom. Our approach was to put in a large video wall that would enable us to dynamically change up the content.”
Initially, Brandon installed a 220-inch screen, comprised of an array of sixteen 55-inch monitors with bezels between each monitor. While he was thrilled with the energy it brought to the showroom, within a few years the system began to experience performance problems. Running with a complex system of components from different manufacturers, the dealership struggled to efficiently manage the technology, which reduced usage. Ultimately, screens began to dim or go fully dark. Frequent screen replacement was required, creating an expensive cost burden. Brandon reached out to their reseller partner Avidex, for help.
### **SOLUTION**
  * ViewSonic® LDM231-251 All-in-One Direct View LED display 
  * Integrated ViewSonic Manager™ device management software 
  * Installation and support by Avidex and ViewSonic Field Solutions Architect 


A long-time ViewSonic partner, the first solution Avidex recommended was the 231-inch ViewSonic® LDM231-251 All-in-One Direct View LED display.
“This incredible product addressed every issue we had with the other systems,” said Brandon. “It’s a complete package from one manufacturer, and it includes easy device management software. It’s absolutely beautiful, with no annoying bezels. And the price was good too, which really amazed me.”
Avidex and ViewSonic worked quickly to present a proposal, which came in right on budget, said Brandon, and the first recommendation became the only one he needed to consider.
### **RESULTS**
  * Stunning 231-inch seamless video wall transformed showroom aesthetics and energy 
  * Reliable all-in-one system resolved previous performance and management issues 
  * Easy setup with complete kit enabled quick, frustrationfree installation 
  * Day-and-night visibility extended promotional impact to freeway traffic 
  * Enhanced content flexibility for events, promotions, and employee recognition 
  * Long LED lifespan reduces maintenance and supports 24/7 use 
  * Dealership excited to expand usage for movie nights, community engagement, and brand storytelling 


As expected, installation of the ViewSonic LDM231-251 Direct View LED display went smoothly. Everything needed, from the LED tiles and AV hardware to the software, power supplies, and cables, came in one package, making for a fast, frustration-free process.
“From pre-sales support to the installation we were very pleased with everything,” said Brandon. “The ViewSonic field solutions architect was there the entire time, overseeing the process. Everything went incredibly smoothly.”
Brandon was amazed at the transformation.
“What had become an eyesore was now a stunning, dynamic video screen,” he said. “Not only is the sheer size impressive, the image clarity is amazing and the content looks much better without the bezels. The entire solution is clean and modern looking, with no stray components or clutter.”
What’s more, said Brandon, Avidex had assured him that the LEDs used in the ViewSonic Direct View LED display are likely to remain functional well beyond the system’s expected operational life, with a rating of up to 100,000 hours of use. This eliminated the worry that screens could burn out with 24/7 use.
“We love leaving the wall running because people can see it from the I-5 freeway,” he said. “But with the other screens we were concerned that they would burn out. We didn’t want that added expense. That’s not an issue with the ViewSonic display. We’re looking forward to running content at 2:00 am with messages like ‘We may be closed but you can still pull over and look at your next new car.’” 
For now, the Capistrano VW showroom team is happy to see their usual dynamic sports content, live cams from local beaches and the San Juan Capistrano train station, and brand content looking so much better on the bright, vibrant screen. The display played a star role in the dealership’s July 2025 showing of the critically-acclaimed Volkswagen-centric movie Circle the Wagen, a feature film that follows the idealistic owner of a 1972 VW bus on an iconic trip down Route 66. 
“It looked so much better than the first time we did this, when the movie was released in 2013,” said Brandon. “It added excitement and energy to the event. We’re looking forward to holding more events like this on a regular basis.” 
The successful installation, outstanding support, and stunning display have motivated Brandon and his team to look for new ways to make use of their video wall. 
“When the other displays were new and looking ok, we used to play loops of fun car content, so we’ll definitely start doing that again,” said Brandon. “With this easier-to-use system we’ll also be adding slideshows of things like employee birthdays or anniversaries, new model release hype, features on new customers, and after-hours promotional messages.” 
Ultimately, the ViewSonic Direct View LED solution enables the Capistrano VW team to deliver dynamic, multipurpose content quickly and easily, thanks to the integrated management software. And with the brighter display, added Brandon, drivers on the freeway can now see their messages during the day, not just at night. 
“After Avidex and ViewSonic got me the initial proposal so quickly, I knew I’d be happy working with them, and the product looked amazing,” said Brandon. “In fact, everything exceeded my expectations. Between ViewSonic and Avidex we feel more comfortable than ever that we’re working with good people that will be there for us if any issues arise.”
