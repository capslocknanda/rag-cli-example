### Applicability 
Note the following behavior:
  

  * Changes made here only affect subscriptions that apply to your personal ViewSonic account (only for the account currently logged in), and primarily targets users who are not registered under an entity.   
  

  * Accounts registered under an entity can also use this page to personally test out free trials under their own account. Some ViewSonic products provide a time-limited offer where users can test out if certain features are right for them. Availability varies and may change without prior notice, so always check with your ViewSonic representative for more details.  
  

  * If you are an Entity admin and need to make changes to subscriptions that apply globally to the whole entity, head over to your **ViewSonic Entity** account page. For more details, refer to the following guide:
