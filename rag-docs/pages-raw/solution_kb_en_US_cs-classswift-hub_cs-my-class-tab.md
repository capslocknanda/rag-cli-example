# Teacher View: My Class Page
The **My Class** page in **ClassSwift Hub** lets teachers manage their classes, student lists, and lesson data.  
From this main page, you can create or open classes. When you open a class, you’ll see four in-class tabs for managing students, groups, lesson records, and AI-generated insights.
  

  

**Main Page – My Class**
**Overview**  
The My Class page is your central dashboard for managing all classes under your teacher account.  
It displays class cards showing class names, student counts, and gives quick access to class details.
**Left Navigation Panel**
  * **My Organization** – Switch between schools or organizations.
  * **User Role** – Displays your account role (for example, Teacher).
  * **My Class** – Access your list of classes.
  * **Plan** - View or upgrade your teacher plan
  * **Settings** – Manage account and organization preferences.


**Top Bar**
  * **Account Menu** – Change language settings or sign out.


**Class Cards**  
Each card displays:
  * Class name and icon (click ⋮ to edit)
  * Maximum number of students.


**Add or Import Classes**
  * **Add Class** – Create a new class manually. Please see article of Add Class for full instructions.
  * **Import from Google Classroom** – Import classes and student lists directly.


**In-Class Tabs**
When you open a class, you’ll see the following four tabs: **Student List** , **Group** , **Lesson Records** , and **Lesson Insights**.
**1. Student List Tab**
The Student List tab lets teachers view students’ details for the selected class.  
You can manage rosters manually or upload a student list using an Excel file. It consists of Display Name, Email, and Group. This tab will be available when the class is created using Google SSO method or imported from Google Classroom.
**2. Group Tab**
The Group tab helps teachers create and manage student groups for in-class activities such as  _Push-and-Respond._ This tab will be available when the class is created using Google SSO method or imported from Google Classroom
**Features**
  * **Regroup** – Randomize or reorganize students.
  * **Group Management Area** – Displays created groups and assigned students.
  * **Group Cards** – Show student names and sequence numbers.
  * **Edit Group Members** – Hover over a student card and click ✏️ to move or edit.


Groups make it easier to organize collaborative or competitive activities.
**3. Lesson Records Tab**
Lesson Records keeps a complete record of past sessions, including attendance, quizzes, and participation data.  
Each row represents one lesson session.
**Lesson Table Columns**
  * **Date** – When the class took place
  * **Time** – Session duration
  * **Usage Time** – Total active time
  * **Attendance** – Students present versus enrolled (e.g., 28/30)

  * **Quiz** – Number of quizzes conducted
  * **Note** – Teacher-added remarks


**Actions**
  * **Add or Edit Note** – Attach class notes.

**Session Details**  
Selecting a lesson opens detailed data:
  * **Lesson Overview** – Attendance, submission rate, and quiz accuracy
  * **Attendance List** – Student participation duration
  * **Task Record** – All content shared during the session
  * **Quiz Record** – Scores, responses, and participants
  * **Insight Result (AI)** – Any generated Lesson Insights


**4. Lesson Insights Tab**
Lesson Insights uses AI to analyze completed lessons and create reports on student participation and performance.
**Before You Begin**  
A lesson must include at least one qualifying quiz question answered by a student.
**Steps**
  1. Select **Grade Level** , **Subject** , and **Lesson**.
  2. Click **Generate (Beta)** to produce a tailored report.


**If You Can’t Generate Insights**
  * _No lessons in the dropdown_ → Ensure the lesson includes a qualifying quiz.
  * _Generate button disabled_ → Complete a quiz in that lesson, then try again.


**Access Notes**
  * Student List and Group tabs are unavailable in  _Guest Mode._
  * Admin users cannot access teacher-specific in-class tabs.
