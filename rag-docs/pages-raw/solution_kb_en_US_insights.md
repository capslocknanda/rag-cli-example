ViewSonic Insights is an online dashboard that provides:

Insights aggregates data from all enrolled devices within the entity and provides a summary organized into several sections. See table below for a quick description of each section: 
  

Section | Data summarized

AI Dashboard | Overall snapshot of users, software downloads, and device activity.  
ViewSonic Devices | Most used apps across your entity's devices, along with detailed app usage statistics.  
myViewBoard | Usage of the myViewBoard app across all platform versions.  
TeamOne | TeamOne session data, including total users and groups.  
Data alert | Set up alerts when certain conditions are met.
