# Present mode
**Present Mode** expands the myViewBoard window to occupy the whole screen. Use this mode to maximize the use of your display's screen area.
  

  

## Using Present Mode
To enter Present Mode, perform the following:
  

  1. Launch myViewBoard.
  2. Click **Present Mode** on the navigation toolbar.  
  

  3. During **Present Mode** :
     * The canvas covers the entire screen.
     * The Windows taskbar becomes hidden.
     * The tabs bar becomes hidden.
     * Objects with the Fade in/out animation become active.  
  

  4. Click **Present Mode** again to exit.  
Note that the myViewBoard window will return to the last size set prior to entering **Present mode**.


  

Alternatively: if you have a physical keyboard attached, press `F11` on the keyboard to toggle **Present Mode** on or off. 
  

  

## Set Mode on startup
By default, myViewBoard launches in **Prepare Mode**. This mode allows full access to the taskbar and is suitable for lesson creation on desktops. 
  

However, you may want to set a myViewBoard installation on IFPs or large screens to always open in **Present Mode**. To set **Present Mode** as the new default for a myViewBoard installation, perform the following:
  

  1. Launch myViewBoard.
  2. (Optional) Sign in to your myViewBoard account.
  3. Click the **user** icon, or your user avatar (if you're logged in).
  4. Click the **Settings** menu.
  5. Click the **System Config** tab.
  6. On the **Default mode** dropdown, select **Present**.  
Your changes are saved automatically.


  

To verify, close and re-launch the myViewBoard app again. myViewBoard should now start full-screen in **Present Mode** , regardless if any user is signed in or not.
  

  

## Update taskbar settings
On Windows, You can override the **Present Mode** behavior by changing your taskbar settings. For more information, see the article below:
