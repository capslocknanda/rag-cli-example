# Device & touch gestures
In addition to mouse and trackpad actions, TeamOne users on a touch display (like a ViewBoard IFP or touch display connected to a desktop) have additional touch gesture options available.

### Panning

  1. Activate the **Select** tool.
  2. Perform one of the following.  
  
| Mouse | Right-click + drag  
---|---|---  
| Touchpad | Right-click + drag  
| Touch | Press + drag using  
two or more fingers   


  

  

  

  

  

### Zooming

  1. Select any tool.
  2. Perform one of the following.  
  
| Mouse | Scroll wheel  
---|---|---  
| Touchpad | Pinch  
| Touch | Pinch using   
two or more fingers  


  

  

  

## Object related

### Select

  1. Activate the **Select** tool.

### Rotate
When selected, a rotate handle

  2. Perform one of the following.  
  
| Mouse | Hold object rotate handle + drag  
---|---|---

**Toggle setting**
You may need to toggle the 3-finger gesture setting when using TeamOne on Windows to perform this action.
  

  

## Touch gestures only
These actions will only activate if the user is on a touch-enabled device.

  1. Select any tool.
  2. Perform the following gesture.  
  
| Touch | Long press in an empty space of the board

Allows users to remove objects without selecting them first. By default, users would need to click the object and select the **Delete** menu from the object toolbar to remove an object. 
  

  1. Select any tool.
  2. Perform the following gesture.  
  
| Touch | Form hand into a closed fist or an open palm first, then gently glide through the board.  
---|---|---
