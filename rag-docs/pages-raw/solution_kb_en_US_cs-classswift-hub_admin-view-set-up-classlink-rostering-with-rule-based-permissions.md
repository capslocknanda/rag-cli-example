# Admin View: Set Up ClassLink Rostering with Rule-Based Permissions
This guide explains how to set up ClassLink rostering with rule-based permissions for ClassSwift.
Schools or districts typically choose rule-based rostering when they need automated, scalable student–staff assignments that follow consistent rules across classes, grades, or roles without requiring manual updates. Please find step-by-step guide on how to set-up here:
## **Step 1. Log in to ClassSwift Hub**
## For New Users (no existing ViewSonic/myViewBoard account):
  * Check your email for an invitation from **no-reply@service.viewsonic.cloud**.
  * Subject: __“A ViewSonic entity has invited you.”__
  * Click **Confirm** to activate your account.
  * Check your email again for a password setup request.
  * Subject: __“Action required to set your password.”__
  * Follow the link to set a password.
  * Fill in your **organization details**.


###  For Existing Users (already have a ViewSonic/myViewBoard account):
  * Log in to **ClassSwift Hub** with your ViewSonic/myViewBoard credentials.


_Reminder: For Entity Admin please always log in with your**ViewSonic email and password** , not ClassLink SSO._
If you want to bind your ViewSonic account to ClassLink:
Go to **ViewSonic Account** → Select **ClassLink** → Click **Connect**
Sign in with your ClassLink credentials
ClassLink will then appear under **Current Login Methods**
## **Step 2. Create Rule-Based Access Permissions**
  1. Log in to **ClassLink LaunchPad**.
  2. Go to **Roster Server > Apps > All Applications**, search for **ClassSwift** , and choose **Rule-Based Permissions**.
  3. Click **+ New Rule** and name it: __ClassSwift Rule (or any name that you prefered to remark this integration)__
  4. In the **Permissions tab** , select by **Teacher / Class / Course** and choose the data you want to roster.
  5. Click **Save**.
  6. In the **Advanced tab** , make sure the following are selected:


  * Users
  * Orgs
  * Enrollment Records
  * Deleted Records
  * Academic Sessions
  * Include Course Academic Session
  * Include Class Academic Session
  * Include Deleted Records (must be checked)
  * Include Active, Expired, and Future Enrollment
  * Include Student Orgs
  * Include Teacher Orgs
  * Include Other User Orgs
  * Include Parent Orgs
  * Include Class Orgs
  * Include Course Orgs
  * Include Enrollment Orgs
  * Include Primary Teachers
  * Include Non-Primary Teachers
  * Include Students
  * Save and apply the rule to **ClassSwift**.


_**Verify by checking****Show Rule Results****. Minimum criteria:**_
_**At least 1 Org, 1 Class, 1 Teacher, 1 Student**_
* * *
## **Step 3. Assign ClassSwift to Users’ LaunchPad**
  1. Go to **Management Console** → **Application** → **Add & Assign Apps**.
  2. Search for **ClassSwift** and assign it to: Tenant Administrators, Teachers, Students


3. The **ClassSwift Hub icon** will appear on LaunchPad homepages.
## **Step 4. Log in to ClassSwift Hub**
  1. Click the **ClassSwift icon** on LaunchPad.
  2. Use **ClassLink SSO** to sign in.


## **Step 5. Authorize ClassLink API**
  1. In ClassSwift Hub, go to **Settings** → Click **Connect** under ClassLink.
  2. Click **Sign in with ClassLink**.
  3. The Tenant ID will be filled in automatically.


## **Step 6. Review ClassLink Roster Data**
  1. Click **Sync All**.
  2. Review the roster data from ClassLink on the **Manage Roster Data** page.


## **Step 7. Sync Roster Data to ClassSwift**
  1. Click **Sync All** (or select specific data to sync).
  2. Click **Confirm**. The status will show **IMPORTING**.
  3. Click **Refresh** until the status changes to **IMPORTED**.


_Note: Each time ClassLink data is updated, the admin must repeat this step in ClassSwift Hub._
## **Step 8. Teacher Impersonation (Optional)**
To test rostering, admins may impersonate a teacher in ClassLink.
Make sure to log out of ClassSwift Hub first to avoid using admin credentials.
Teachers will see **ClassSwift** on their LaunchPad but will not receive an automatic email. Admins must notify teachers directly.
✨ That’s it! Your ClassLink rostering with rule-based permissions is now set up for ClassSwift.
