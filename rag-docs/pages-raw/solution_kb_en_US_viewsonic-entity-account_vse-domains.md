# Domains
Use the **Domains** page to manage the domains associated with your entity. This page allows admins to perform the following: 
  

  * Add and verify new domains to your entity 
  * Review which domains are already verified or are pending verification.
  * Remove expired domains


  

  

  

## About domains
During creation, every entity is required to register under a single main domain. Since this main domain usually matches the email addresses of its target users, ViewSonic uses this "domain information" to verify if a user is a valid member of an entity. 
  

In some cases, ViewSonic may register a school or an organization under an alias domain, which uses the following format:
  

  * dnmxntk5mdm4ody0mdqw.at.viewsonic.cloud


  

Afterwards, more domains may be added either manually, or automatically via user synchronization.
  

  

## Add domains manually
If any additional domains are needed, perform the following:
  

  1. Click domain **Domains** on the left-side menu.
  2. Click domain_add **Add Domain**.
  3. In the **Create domain** dialog, type the domain to add.
  4. Click **Next**.   
  

  5. In the **Verify domain** dialog, perform the following.
    1. Select between MX or TXT.
    2. Afterwards, head over to your domain registrar's control panel and create the MX or TXT record with the details provided in the dialog. It is highly important that the details shown in the dialog and the new record you create are an exact match.
    3. Click the **Verify** button once you are done creating the records.  
  

  6. If the domain was successfully added: 
    1. The domain is added to the domain list. 
    2. The **Verified** icon appears under the **Status** column.   
  

  7. If you clicked the **Verify later** button: 
    1. The domain is added to the domain list. 
    2. The **Verify domain** icon appears under the **Status** column.
    3. Click **Verify domain** to restart the verification process.


  

Continue adding domains as needed. If you encounter an error during the verification process, please submit a ticket to our support team.
  

  

## Add domains via user sync
New domains are also automatically added to your entity via SSO integration. For more details, refer to the article below: 
  

  * [Microsoft Entra ID or Google Workspace](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/entity-management-1/sync-users)


  

After the sync process is complete, any unique domain that came with your newly added users will also be added to your domains list.
