# myViewBoard user portal
The myViewBoard portal allows students and collaborators to participate interactively with a myViewBoard session, through a desktop web browser of a device provided by the school, such as a laptop or tablet.
  

Use the portal when users are not able to interact with myViewBoard through the Companion app, especially for educational institutions that do not allow the use of mobile devices in class.
  

  

## Sharing a session
The myViewBoard host must first share the session code. 
  

  

  

Prepare the session:
  1. Launch the myViewBoard app. 
  2. Sign in with the account that you will use to host the session.
  3. After signing in,  tap your board name at the top left. If you haven't customized the board name, this will be your username or email.
  4. This opens up a new window with your MyViewBoard portal URL and a QR code for quick access.


  

Share the Portal URL with students:
  1. Share your portal URL or QR code with students, either through your LMS (e.g., Google Classroom) or via other communication tools.
  2. Have your students perform one of the following: 
     * Open a browser on their device and type your portal's URL address. 
     * Use a mobile device's camera to scan a QR code that links to your portal.
  3. Bookmark the URL for easy access.


  

  

For more details, refer to the article below:
  * [Share myViewBoard session](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/classroom-engagement/share-whiteboard-session)


  

  

## Joining the portal
Now that we have the URL / QR code of the myViewBoard portal, we can ask participants to join.
  

Procedures for joining a myViewBoard portal are slightly different for guests than it is for users who are already signed in to myViewBoard.com. If a user does not have a myViewBoard account, they can still participate by logging in as a portal _guest_.
  

_To join as a guest:_
  1. Launch a web browser. 
  2. Type the **URL** of the myViewBoard portal shared by the host. 
  3. On the next page:
    1. Type a guest name in the **Your name** field.
    2. Click **Confirm**.  
  

  4. The participant is redirected to the host's myViewBoard portal.
  5. Note that the portal will use the guest name provided to report the participant's actions in the session. 


  

  

_To join as a myViewBoard user:_
  1. Launch a browser and and sign in to 
  2. Open a new tab and type the **URL** of the myViewBoard portal shared by the host.
  3. The participant is redirected to the host's myViewBoard portal.
  4. Note that the portal will use the participant's profile name to report their actions in the session. 


  

  

It is highly recommended to use a Chromium-based browser like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge to access the portal.
  

Participants using the Companion app can join the session by simply scanning the **QR code** provided by the host. Since the Companion app requires users to be logged in, the portal will use the participant's profile name to report their actions in the session. 
  

  

  

## Session password 
If the [host has set a session password](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/account-settings/followme-settings#set-a-session-password-2), participants joining via the web browser have to provide the session password to join. Companion app users will also be asked to provide this password along with the host name.
  

For more details, refer to the following article: 
  * [Share your session password from within myViewBoard](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/classroom-engagement/share-whiteboard-session#inviting-when-session-password-is-enabled-2)

Once connected to the host's myViewBoard portal, participant gain access to the following actions:
  

### Screen sharing
Teachers must set up their myViewBoard first to send and receive screens from selected students. To prepare the myViewBoard for sending and receiving screens, refer to the article below:

  4. Contents of the selected screen should appear on the host's myViewBoard.

     * Select 
     * Select 
  3. Click **Send**
  4. The answer will be available on the host's **Pop Quiz** popup.


  

  

### Polls
Polls allow teachers to prepare a specific set of questions to collect student responses, and have the responses tallied up and displayed on the myViewBoard canvas. To start a poll as well as get info on what question types are available, refer to the following article: 
  * [Start a poll in myViewBoard](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/mvb30-poll)

  2. When ready, click **Submit**.
  3. The response will be logged in the Polls session [for the host to review](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/student-engagement/polls#reviewing-responses-8).


  

  

### Throw
Teachers can also invite participants to send files to the canvas, allowing the teacher to open the file to display to the class. For more information on this process as well as which file types can be sent, refer to the article below: 
  * [Share local files to a myViewBoard session](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/mvb30-throw)


  

Once the teacher and the myViewBoard is ready, participants use the portal to send their files to the myViewBoard canvas:
  

  1. Note the area on the portal where the big rectangular box appears.
  2. In this section, perform one of the following:
    1. Drag and drop files into this area.
    2. Click **Browse files** to select files from your local drive.  
  

  3. Wait for a confirmation message.
  4. If successful, the host should see a notification on the myViewBoard toolbar.
