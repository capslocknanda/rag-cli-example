# Touchback
By default, participants can only view the screen during a sharing session. To allow interaction with the shared content, enable **Touchback** for the connected devices.
  

This feature allows users to: 
  * Control IFP content directly from their devices. 
  * Engage with IFP content from anywhere in the room.
  * Collaborate simultaneously, especially when touchback is enabled for multiple users. 
  * Enhance accessibility for users with mobility needs. 

  
  

## Enable on the IFP
Enabling touchback on the IFP enables users to interact with the IFP content using their devices. All inputs made by the users on their devices (via mice, touch, pen, etc.) will be forwarded to the IFP. To activate touchback on the IFP, perform the following: 
  

_On the IFP:_
  1. First, perform the steps shown here to share an IFP screen to a device:  
  

     * [Share IFP to device](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/share-ifp-to-device "Share IFP to device")  
  

  2. Wait for the target device to connect. Once connected, the target device should appear on the **Device list** using the name provided during the connection setup.   
  

  3. Now, tap the **Touchback button** beside the entry for the target device.   
All touch data (or mouse clicks) over the AirSync Sender are now forwarded to the IFP. Note the following behavior:
     * The user can only interact with UI elements inside the ViewBoard OS.
     * The host can enable touchback for multiple devices.
     * The host maintains full software and hardware control over the IFP.  
  

  4. Tap the **Disable** icon to stop the user from interacting. The user loses control over the IFP but can still view the IFP screen on their device.
  5. Tap the **Touchback** button again to re-enable control for the last user, or grant control to another user.
  6. Tap the **Remove** icon to disconnect a device and clear up an entry on the **Device list**. This also stops the disconnected user from viewing the IFP screen.


  

  

## Touchback off
## Touchback on
  

  

  

  

Note that touchback option can only be enabled for devices that connect with the AirSync Sender app. Devices that use the AirSync Web Sender to connect will not have the touchback option available.
  

## Enable on a device
Enabling touchback on a device enables users to use the IFP to interact with the content on the sharing device. All inputs (touch, pen, mice, etc.) made on the IFP will be forwarded to the device. To activate the touchback feature on the sharing device, perform the following: 
  

  

_On the device:_
  1. First, perform the steps shown here to share your device screen to the IFP:  
  

     * [Cast from AirSync](https://www.viewsonic.com/send-your-screen/cast-from-airsync-client "Cast from AirSync client")  
  

  2. Wait for your screen to show up on the target device. Once connected, the AirSync app should display a set of options to manage your session on the bottom left.   
  
  
  
  

  3. Click the **Touchback** toggle to turn the feature on. 
  4. Now, go to the IFP that is showing your screen and interact with the content. The content should react to your inputs as if you were in front of your own device  
  

  5. Click the **Touchback** toggle again to stop the IFP from sending inputs to the device. The IFP screen still shows the device content but users can no longer use the IFP to interact with the device.  

  6. Click the **Stop** button to terminate the sharing session. 


  

Starting from AirSync version v3.6.7, the Touchback toggle is set to on by default for better user experience.
  

## Managing touchback
Note the following behavior:
  

  * On IFPs, the touchback option can only be enabled for devices that connect with the AirSync Sender app. The **Device list** will not show the touchback option for devices that use the AirSync Web Sender to connect.
  * On the AirSync Sender app, the touchback option is only available on the Windows, macOS and Android versions. 
  * During split-screen mode, touchback technically still works but may not be accurate. It is highly recommended to set the target panel to full-screen mode first before enabling touchback. 


  
  

### Android devices
The Android version of AirSync Sender uses the **Android Accessibility Service** to control the device. To enable touchback, follow the steps below:
  

  1. Open the AirSync Sender app on your Android device.
  2. Use the AirSync Sender and connect to AirSync.   
If the Accessibility Services on the device are not enabled, a reminder message appears.  
  

  3. If you agree to the message, click the **Allow** button.  
  

  4. On the **Accessibility settings** screen: 
    1. Select **Downloaded Apps**. 
    2. Then select **AirSync Sender**.  
  

  5. If you agree to authorize full control of your device through AirSync Sender, activate the entry for AirSync Sender.
  6. Read the information presented, then click **OK.**


  

Afterwards, you should be able to control your device from the IFP via touchback.
  
  

### iOS devices
Due to iOS limitations, the iOS version of the AirSync Sender app does not support the touchback feature. However, you can still use AirPlay and share screen to AirSync using a Bluetooth connection between the device and the IFP with touchback function.
  

_System requirements_
  * iPad and iPadOS version 17 or later.
  * The IFP must be connected to a Wi-Fi dongle that supports AirSync. 
  * Both the device end and the IFP end need to enable the Bluetooth function.


  

_Limitation_
  * Only the single-touch gesture can emulate the left mouse button function. Gestures, dragging, and scrolling are not supported.
  * When multiple AirPlay devices are projected at the same time, only one device can activate the touchback.
  * The IFP105 model will support this feature in 2025 Q3.
  * The IFP52-1A and IFP52-1B models do not support this feature.


  

_Instruction_
  1. Make sure both the iPad and the IFP have their Bluetooth function enabled.
  2. Have the iPad device share its screen to the IFP via AirPlay.
  3. On the iPad, go to **Settings** then select and stay in the **Bluetooth** view waiting for pairing and connection.   

  4. On the IFP side, tap the touchback button in the screen control bar.  
  
  
  

  5. If your iPad device has not yet completed Bluetooth pairing with the IFP, follow the prompts on the IFP and iPad screens to complete the Bluetooth pairing.   
  

  6. After the Bluetooth pairing and connection between the iPad and the IFP is completed, the iPad device can be controlled on the IFP side.
