# Import lessons
If you already have existing materials for your lessons, myViewBoard allows you to import these materials into the canvas.
  

  * If your lessons are in .OLF format, you can directly open them
  * If your lessons are in other formats (PDF, PPTX, etc.), you can import them
  * If you need sample lessons in .OLF format, check out myViewBoard Originals.


  

  

## Open existing files 
If your lessons are already in .OLF format, myViewBoard can directly open them. To open files, use **File Manager** to browse the user's local and cloud drives. 
  

  1. Launch myViewBoard.
  2. Click the **File manager** to open the **File Management** window.   
By default, **Open OLF** is the active tab.  
  

  3. By default, myViewBoard displays the contents of the local device. If a cloud drive is connected, click the cloud drive tab above to display its contents.  
  

  4. Navigate through the directory and locate your .OLF file.
  5. Double-click the .OLF file to open. Note that large files may take some time to completely open. 
  6. Make changes to the file as needed.  
  

  7. To apply your changes: 
    1. Click **File Manager**
    2. Click **Save**


  

File Manager only supports opening files saved in the Open Learning Format (OLF) file type. For users on Windows, you can also double-click an .OLF file in the Windows File Explorer to auto-open the file using myViewBoard.
  

  

  

## Import files
If you already have existing files or lessons in other formats, you can insert them into the canvas. myViewBoard supports inserting files from your local or cloud drives. To import, perform the following:
  

_From File Manager:_
  1. Click **File Manager** on the main toolbar
  2. Click **Import Files** on the left panel.


  

  

This will launch the **Import** window. Afterwards, do the following:
  

  1. By default, myViewBoard displays the contents of the local device. If a cloud drive is connected, click the cloud drive tab above to display its contents.  
  

  2. Navigate through the directory and locate the file to import.
  3. Double-click the file to insert it into the canvas. For a list of supported file types, see the [Supported file formats](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/mvb30-lesson-delivery/_import-lessons#supportedFormats) section below. Note that large files may take some time to insert.
  4. Make changes to the file as needed.  
  

  5. To apply your changes:
    1. Click **File Manager**
    2. Click **Save**


  

  

For users on Windows, you can drag the file directly from the Windows File Explorer to the myViewBoard canvas for a faster import. This also works for multiple files.
  

  

### Sign in required
The following features are only available to users who are signed in:
  

  * Access to their cloud drives. Note that this requires a user to setup a connection to a cloud service provider first.
  * Add unlimited pages. For users not signed-in, myViewBoard allows a max number of 5 pages. 


  

  

## Supported file formats
The list below list various files types that can be imported into the canvas. During import, myViewBoard converts them into objects that you can further edit on the canvas. Note that large files may take some time to import.
  

### Whiteboard formats
myViewBoard supports importing other interactive whiteboard formats:
  

Platform | File Extension  
---|---  
myViewBoard |  .VBOARD and .OLF  
Promethean |  .FLP (Flipchart)  
SMART | .NOTEBOOK  
Evernote | .ENB  
Other brands | .IWB  
  

  

Note the following behavior:
  * You can use myViewBoard to edit files from other providers. However, you must save these files in the .OLF format to retain your edits.
  * While .FLP files saved by older versions of Promethean are supported, myViewBoard may have issues importing .FLP files created from newer versions.
  * You can try myViewBoard's **File Conversion to OLF file** service if the imported files are not converted properly.


  

  

### Office formats
The following office document formats can be imported into the canvas:  
  
Type | File Extension  
---|---  
Documents | Google Doc, PDF, DOCX, TXT, ONE, URL  
Presentations | Google Slides, PPTX (excluding PowerPoint mobile files)  
  

An error may occur when importing a Google Slide or Google Doc file if it exceeds the 10MB limit during conversion. To resolve this, download the Google Slide or Google Doc file as a PDF first, then import this PDF into myViewBoard instead.
  

  

### Image & multimedia
The following multimedia formats are supported:
Type | File Extension  
---|---  
Images | PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, ICO, TIF, TIFF, SVG  
Audio | MP3, AAC, WMA, WAV, M4A  
Video | WMV, MP4, MPG, XESC, 3PG, MOV, MPEG, MKV, ASF, AVI, M4V
