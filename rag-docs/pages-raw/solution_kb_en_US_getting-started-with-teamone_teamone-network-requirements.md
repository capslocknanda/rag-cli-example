# Network settings
To enhance your TeamOne experience, ensure that the following network settings are properly configured.
  

## Network requirements
Since TeamOne relies on a consistent internet connection, ensure that your internet connection is reliable and stable.
If your connection is unreliable or goes through periods of limited bandwidth, TeamOne performance will be affected. Issues you may encounter include:
  

  1. Slow loading of boards. 
  2. Lagging when panning and zooming in the canvas.


  

  

The minimum and recommended network speed: 
  * **Minimum** : 10 Mbps download/10 Mbps upload
  * **Recommended** : 100 Mbps download/40 Mbps upload on a wired connection


  

  

## Firewall
### Filter by domain
To ensure seamless usage of TeamOne, add the following domains in your firewall’s **Allow** list:
  

**Domain** | **Purpose**  
---|---  
auth.viewsonic.io | Sign up/in service  
*.myviewboard.com | TeamOne API domain  
myviewboard.com | TeamOne API domain  
teamone.myviewboard.com | Main application's domain  
www.youtube.com | Play videos imported from YouTube  
i.ytimg.com | YouTube image domain  
*.sharepoint.com | Microsoft OneDrive integration  
js.live.net | Microsoft OneDrive integration  
*.giphy.com | Imports GIFs from Giphy  
api.bing.microsoft.com | Import images from Bing search  
*.mm.bing.net | Import images from Bing search  
*.explicit.bing.net | Import images from Bing search  
*.in.applicationinsights.azure.com | Analyze user behavior  
graph.microsoft.com | Microsoft OneDrive integration  
o4505304380866560.ingest.sentry.io | Monitor system errors  
*.googleusercontent.com  | Google user's avatar domain  
mvb-teamwork-frankfurt.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com | Store user-uploaded data  
mvb-teamwork-singapore.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com | Store user-uploaded data  
mvb-teamwork-virginia.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com | Store user-uploaded data  
### Filter by AWS IP ranges
If filtering by domain is not an option, we recommend filtering by the AWS IP ranges for all US-East regions. You can find those ranges and other filtering advice at the following link:
  

Please note that because our IP addresses ranges are not static, we cannot provide a list of specific IP addresses to allow. This measure ensures smooth usage of TeamOne while safeguarding sensitive information transmitted between your web browser and the website. 
  

### TCP 443
Ensure that port TCP 443 is in your firewall's **Allow** list. Alternatively, you can also open port 443 by configuring the firewall or router to allow incoming and outgoing web traffic on that port. 
  

Note that port 443 is crucial for TeamOne to ensure secure internet communication. Since it serves as the universal web browsing port for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), port 443 can safeguard sensitive information transmitted between web browsers and websites. When users access an HTTPS site, their web browser establishes a secure connection with the web server using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. 
  

  

## WebSocket
### Enable WebSockets
TeamOne establishes connections between servers, applications, and browsers to enable real-time collaboration, via the _WebSockets_ protocol. To verify if WebSockets are enabled, head over to the site below: 
  

  

If WebSockets are not enabled, contact your IT team. To ensure that your team can use TeamOne, we recommend the following guidelines: 
  

  1. Allow WebSockets and secure WebSockets. 
  2. Avoid manipulating headers or user agents internally on IDS/IPS. 
  3. Do not filter protocol updates.


  

  

### Proxy
If your network requires a proxy, follow the recommended settings below: 
  

  * **Proxy server** must support WebSocket connections (HTTP/2). 
  * **Proxy HTTP version** should be set as 1.1. 
  * **Destination port** : 443 (SSL), for HTTPS.
  * **Protocol** : HTTPS SSL3.0 
  * **Timeout value** on the proxy server should be extended. Most systems default to waiting around 60-90 seconds to connect. We recommend extending the duration to 120-180 seconds. 
  * The proxy server should not truncate the request and response headers. Check if the **Upgrade** and **Connection** headers are proxied by the client.
