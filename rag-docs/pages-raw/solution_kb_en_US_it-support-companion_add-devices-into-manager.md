# Add devices into Manager with Companion
is a tool for **entity admins** to remotely manage multiple installations of ViewSonic devices.
Once Viewsonic devices are set up and have the **myViewBoard Manager****app** installed, they can be added to an entity and managed remotely from the Manager web app (available to Entity Admins after signing into myviewboard.com).
To add devices and remotely manage them, use the **Companion App** to register the device under your entity. Just scan the **QR code**. No need to fill out a form or input sign-in details. 
## **On the device to manage**
Launch **myViewBoard****Manager** app on your ViewSonic ViewBoard to display a unique QR code.
## **On the Companion App**
  1. Launch the **Entity Admin** account.
  2. Tap the QR-reader function 
  3. Input device information as needed.
  4. Click **Submit** to add the device to **Manager**.
  5. This device should now appear in your device list within the Manager console.
