# Firewall Whitelisting
Use the **Firewall Whitelisting** page to review firewall port and whitelisting requirements so myViewBoard services can run as expected.
  

  

  

## How to access
To access this page:
  1. Sign in to 
  2. On the landing page, locate the **myViewBoard** tile.   
Note the ellipsis icon when you hover over.
  3. Click the **myViewBoard admin settings**.
  4. The **myViewBoard admin settings** page appears.
  5. Click **Firewall Whitelisting** on the side panel.


  

  

**Important**
  

  * Any changes made here only apply to your myViewBoard environment. 
  * You can only access this page if any of the following conditions are true: 
    * You have signed in under a myViewBoard owner account 
    * You have been assigned with the Admin role for the myViewBoard app


  

‍ 
  

## Requirements table
Note the following details:
  

  * This page contains a table that provides details on IP addresses and ports that myViewBoard apps use to connect with the service. Admins must ensure that the firewall where the myViewBoard app operates has been configured properly so these addresses and ports are allowed on the network.  
  

  * Click **Check connectivity with myViewBoard** to verify that the current device can establish communication with the myViewBoard servers. This opens a new page and starts a Diagnostic test:  
  

    * Before testing, ensure that you are in the correct location where your target apps will operate, or you are in an environment that accurately simulates the conditions for real-world use.
    * The Diagnostic test may request permissions to access your mic and camera to perform some of the tests.
    * If any of the tests fail, check your network configuration, or contact a ViewSonic representative for assistance.
