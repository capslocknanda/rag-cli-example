# Install AirSync on IFP
By default, AirSync comes pre-installed on new ViewSonic Interactive Flat Panels (IFPs). In case AirSync is missing, follow the steps below to deploy and manage the AirSync application to your devices. Note that these steps also apply to ViewSonic EDLA (Enterprise Device Licensing Agreement) interactive flat panels.
  

## Install via Manager
Use the default app list within Manager to install AirSync on multiple devices at the same time.
  

  1. Login to Manager.
  2. Click **Devices** on the left side panel.  
  

  3. On the device list, select target devices for installation.   
Ensure the **Allow installation of unknown sources** is ON for all target devices.  
  

  4. On the top toolbar: 
    1. Click **Apps**. 
    2. Click **Install** from the dropdown.  
  

  5. On the **Install Apps** popup: 
    1. Select **AirSync**. 
    2. Click **Confirm**.


  

### Troubleshooting: Uninstallation
If the installation fails, use the **Uninstall** command to reset AirSync to the factory default version first before attempting the installation process.
  

  1. Login to Manager.
  2. Click **Devices** on the left side panel.
  3. On the device list, select target devices.  
  

  4. On the top toolbar:
    1. Click **Apps**. 
    2. Click **Uninstall** from the dropdown.  
  

  5. In the **Uninstall Apps** popup: 
    1. Select **AirSync**. 
    2. Click **Confirm**.


  

  

  

## Install via APK file
If you need to install a specific version of AirSync via an APK file, follow the steps below. For example, the AOSP version APK of AirSync cannot coexist with the EDLA version APK. Manager allows only one version of the AirSync APK to be uploaded at a time, and each version needs to be processed separately.
  

  

  

_Upload the APK as an external app_
Upload the correct APK version first to make it available for deployment.
  

  1. Log on to Manager.
  2. Click **Apps** on the left toolbar.
  3. On this section:
    1. Click 
    2. Select the AirSync apk to upload.   
Note that AirSync can only have one copy uploaded. The AOSP version cannot coexist with EDLA version and each needs to be processed separately.  
  

  4. Once the upload is complete: 
    1. Click **⋮ Options** on the AirSync card .
    2. Click **Edit app details**.
    3. Modify the **App title**. This title will be used to locate the correct APK later. 


  

  

  

_Install the APK to the IFP_
Afterwards, deploy this specific version remotely through Manager.
  

  1. Login to Manager.
  2. Click **Devices** on the left side panel.  
  

  3. On the device list, select target devices for installation.   
Ensure the **Allow installation of unknown sources** is ON for all target devices.  
  

  4. On the top toolbar: 
    1. Click **Apps**. 
    2. Click **Install** from the dropdown.  
  

  5. In the **Install Apps** popup:
    1. Type the “App title” in the search column to locate the APK uploaded earlier. Do not select the default AirSync app (with the ? icon in the Version column). 
    2. Select the APK. 
    3. Click **Confirm**. 


  

Since AOSP and EDLA models must be processed separately, delete the uploaded APK from Manager once the installation for one model (AOSP or EDLA) is complete. Afterwards, repeat the upload and install process for the other models.
  

## Sideload via APK file
To install or update AirSync on a single panel when centralized deployment is not possible, perform the following steps:
  

  1. On another device:
    1. Download the AirSync APK file. 
    2. Save this file to a USB drive.  
  

  2. Insert the USB drive into the IFP. 
  3. On your IFP:
    1. Locate the **File** app.
    2. Verify that the **Install unknown apps** option is enabled in the **File** app settings on your panel.  
  

  4. Open the **File** app:
    1. Navigate to your USB device.
    2. Locate and tap the AirSync APK file. 
    3. On the “Do you want to update this app?” message, select "Update."  
  

  5. Wait for the installation process to complete.
