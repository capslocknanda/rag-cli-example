# DACO assistant
DACO is an AI-powered assistant that provides data analysis and navigation within Insights. Use DACO to check current data insights without manually sifting through large datasets.   
  
  
With DACO, admins can instantly access summaries, key metrics, and guided navigation to specific sections of the app, helping streamline daily workflows and improve data-driven decision-making.
  

  

## Access DACO
To access DACO, follow the steps below:
  

  1. Click the icon on the bottom right to launch the DACO chat window.
  2. On first use, DACO will inform you of its [Terms of Use](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/insights-ai-tools/insights-daco-assistant#privacyPolicy).   
Review, then click **Continue** to proceed.  
  

  3. Formulate your query in one of the following formats:
    1. Request a data summary. Type a request for an overview (e.g., “Provide a summary of weekly activity”). DACO will display a concise summary.
    2. Navigate to a specific section. Ask DACO to take you to a section (e.g., “Show me account settings”). DACO will guide you there.
    3. Retrieve specific statistics. Request specific data points (e.g., “Show current user counts”). DACO will provide the exact numbers.  
  

  4. Review the responses.   
You may need to prompt again to get more specific answers.
  5. Click the icon again to close the chat window. 


  

  

  

## Additional details
Note the following behavior:
  

  * Remember that AI isn't perfect and may occasionally misinterpret your request.  
  

  * Responses are not saved and will be lost when you refresh the page. Ensure that you copy-paste important responses to a safe location.  
  

  * Admins can ask up to five queries per entity daily. Usage count resets after 24 hours. Once you have used up all of the five queries, a countdown timer appears on top of the chat window.  
  

  * Responses where DACO cannot provide an answer are counted against the query quota.  
  

  * With five questions per entity daily, focus queries on essential data needs to avoid reaching the limit prematurely. Direct, specific questions help DACO deliver the most relevant insights.
