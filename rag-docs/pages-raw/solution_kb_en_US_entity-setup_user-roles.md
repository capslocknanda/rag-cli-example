# Roles after entity creation
Entities initially have two distinct user roles to allow for granular admin configuration of the ViewSonic Entity account after creation. 
  

  

## During entity request
Organizations that plan to send a request to be an entity must specify the following _required_ user roles during registration:
  

  * **Entity owner**.   
The first user role created is the **Entity owner**. This user is the individual who filled in the [Entity Signup Form](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/entity-setup/request-entity-account). The user assigned with an Entity owner role cannot be deleted as long as the entity account is active and they are assigned the owner role.  
  

  * **Entity admin**.   
When filling out the Entity Signup Form, an Entity owner must also specify at least one other individual who will act as the **Entity admin**.


  

  

## After entity creation
After entity creation, both Entity owner and Entity admin are granted access to the **ViewSonic Entity portal**. This portal allows them to assign various roles to entity users. For more information on how to assign roles to other users, see the article below:
  

  * [ViewSonic Entity - Admin Roles](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/viewsonic-entity-account/vse-admin-roles)


  

  

## Owner role
Additional information about the owner role:
  

  * Ther can only be one Owner.
  * Only the Owner can re-assign the Owner role to another user. Once re-assigned, the previous owner cannot assign the role back; they would have to request the new owner to return it back.
  * If the current entity owner is no longer active and you wish to transfer the owner status to an active account, please seek out your local ViewSonic representative, or submit a ticket to our Support Team at the following link:
