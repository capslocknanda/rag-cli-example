# Teacher View: Add Class
Before you begin an interactive session, set up your class and enroll your students in ClassSwift Hub.
**Instructions**
  1. On the **My Class** page, click **“Add Class.”**
  2. Decide how your students will join:


    * **Google Sign-In** – students log in with their Google accounts.
    * **Guest Mode** – students join without logging in.
    * Rostering Platform or Learning Management System – we partnered with ClassLink and Google Classroom at the moment. These options will be available for paid customers.


**Option A — Students Join with Google Sign-In**
Choose this option if you want students to sign in using their Google accounts.
  1. After clicking **“Add Class,”** enter your class details (Class Name and Number of Students).
  2. Under **“Require Students to Sign In,”** select **Google**. Make sure all students have an active Google email address.
  3. Click **Add** to create the class. 
  4. Open the class you just created and click **“Invite Student.”**
  5. A pop-up will display a link to join — share this with your students.
  6. When students click the link, they will log in with their Google account to participate.


If a teacher uses this method to create a class, in My Class section they will see this view
**Troubleshooting:**
**Option B — Students Join in Guest Mode**
Choose this option for quick sessions where no login is required.
  1. After clicking **“Add Class,”** enter your class details (Class Name and Number of Students).
  2. Under **“Require Students to Sign In,”** select **Guest Mode**.
  3. Share the provided link with students — they can join instantly without logging in.


**Tip:** Use **Google Sign-In** for secure, ongoing classes. Use **Guest Mode** for quick, one-time sessions.
**Troubleshooting:**
If a teacher uses this method to create a class, in My Class section they will see this view
