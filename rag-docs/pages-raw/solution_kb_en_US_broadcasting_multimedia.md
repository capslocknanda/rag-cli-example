## Supported file types
Manager supports the following multimedia file types for broadcast:
  

Media type | Format | Size limit  
---|---|---  
Video | MP4 | 500 MB  
Image | JPG, PNG | 30 MB  
Audio | MP3, AAC | 30 MB  
  

  

## Add to a layout
To add multimedia to a broadcast, perform the following:
  

  1. Go to the **All Devices** page.
  2. Select one or more devices in the list.   
Selected devices must all have an **Advanced license** assigned.  
  

  3. Click the **Broadcast****Broadcast** popup.  
  

  4. Click **Media Content** as the **Broadcast Type**.   
The Media content option is only available if all selected devices have an **Advanced license** assigned.  
  

  5. Note the **Layout** options at the bottom of the preview:
    1. Select a **Layout**.   
By default, all options here are for **Landscape** mode.   
Click **Portrait** mode to see options for vertical layouts.  
  

    2. Click **Add content** on the panel where the media should appear. 
    3. Select **Multimedia** from the dropdown menu. 


  

  

  

Note the following behavior:
  * Any multimedia must be added to Manager first before you can use it here.
  * The default layout option supports broadcasting only one media content. Select this layout to have your chosen media take up the entire screen.
  * Aspect ratios for each section are fixed: 
    * Try to match image and video resolutions before hand to fit the sections you intend to insert them in. 
    * Images not matching a section's aspect ratio will be automatically resized to fit that layout section.


  

  

## Start a broadcast
Once the selected media are inserted, perform the following to send the broadcast.
  

  1. Verify that all media have been added to the message to broadcast. 
  2. Select the broadcast duration:
     * **Continuous**. Displays the message until device users dismiss the broadcast, or a Manager admin stops the broadcast.
     * **Custom**. Sets a custom duration for the broadcast. Message is auto-dismissed once the duration has been reached.   
  

  3. (Optional) Select the **Forbid device user from stopping broadcast** option to prevent users from stopping the broadcast manually. If not checked, users can stop / hide / dismiss a broadcast from displaying on their device even if the **Continuous** or **Custom** duration was set.   
  

  4. Click **Confirm** to start the broadcast.


  

  

  

## Options for Video
If a video is added to the **Single media layout** option, the following option becomes available:
  

**Duration.** Set options for video playback during the broadcast.
  * **Play once.** Video starts playing immediately and then ends after one time.
  * **Continuous**. Video plays then repeats indefinitely until the broadcast is stopped.
  * **Custom**. Sets a custom duration for the broadcast. The video stops playing once the limit is reached.
