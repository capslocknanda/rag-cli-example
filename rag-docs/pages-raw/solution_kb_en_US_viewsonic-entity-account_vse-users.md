     * <https://cloud.viewsonic.com/entity>

  1. Click group**Users** on the left panel.
  2. Click **More options** keyboard_arrow_down.
  3. Click **Bulk upload users**.
  4. Click **Choose file**.
  5. Click **Upload** to import your updated CSV file.  
  

  6. A successful import triggers the following:
    1. The **Success** notification appears 
    2. The system sends out the following: 
       * For Public entities: email invites to all users in the list.
       * For Regular and Shared entities: notification emails.


  

  

## Sync via SSO
myViewBoard offers several options for adding users via single sign-on (SSO): 
  

  * Google Workspace
  * Microsoft Entra ID
  * Microsoft Entra ID SCIM
  * ClassLink


  

Before proceeding, login as administrator of your Microsoft Entra ID (Global Administrator), Google Workspace (Super Admin), or any other account you will configure for SSO, and enable the mailbox of any user that will be added to your entity. This ensures that they can receive important updates after the process is complete.

  1. Click group**Users** on the left panel.
  2. Click **More options** keyboard_arrow_down.
  3. Click **Sync users with Google Workspace**.
  4. On the next page, sign in with your Google Workspace Super Admin account.   
Allow permissions if necessary.  
  

  5. If login was successful: 
    1. Verify that the value for **Your domain** shows the correct target.
    2. Otherwise, click the dropdown and switch to the correct one.  
  

  6. Select one of the following sync options:  
  

     * **All users**.  
Create accounts for all users in your organization.  
  

     * **Group**.   
Create accounts for pre-defined groups in your organization.  
  

     * **Unit**.   
Create accounts for pre-configured units in your organization.  
  

     * **Keep current users**.  
If checked, previously added users will remain in the entity. This is checked by default.  
  

  

  7. Click the **Sync** button button and wait for the sync process to complete.
  8. To verify that the sync was a success:
    1. New users from your domain are now listed in the **Users** page 
    2. These new users can now use the **Google SSO** option to successfully access the ViewSonic dashboard.
