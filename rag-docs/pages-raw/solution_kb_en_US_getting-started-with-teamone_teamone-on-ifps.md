# TeamOne on IFPs
When launched on supported IFPs, TeamOne will present a blank canvas on start up. Users can use the canvas for quick collaboration even without signing in. 
  

## Default behavior
Tap the TeamOne icon on the IFP to launch the app. On startup:
  

  * Users need to agree to the privacy consent form to continue.   
Click **Customize settings** to adjust how TeamOne manages cookies for the session. The following cookies can be managed: 
    * Necessary cookies
    * Analytics cookies  
  

  * Users can start using the board and have access to the commonly used tools. 
    * Select
    * Sticky notes
    * Text
    * Shapes
    * Pen
    * Eraser   
  

  * The following touch features are also available. 
    * Touch gestures
    * Palm eraser
    * Drag to navigate


  

  

## Sign-in required
Note that the TeamOne app preinstalled on IFPs (or installed via the IFP apk) does not require the internet to load the blank canvas on startup or use basic tools. Users will only need the internet if they need to sign in and use the following features:
  

  * **Use of AI features**  
Text summaries, handwriting and shape recognition  
  

  * **Import of resources**  
Importing resources from local and online sources, opening saved boards  
  

  * **Export**   
Saving and downloading boards to the local drive  
  

  * **Collaboration tools**  
Sharing via QR codes, voting, commenting, and laser pen


  

  

[Delete](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/getting-started-with-teamone/teamone-on-ifps)
**Important**
For security reasons, closing the TeamOne app will automatically sign out any currently logged in user. If there has been no activity on the board for 1 hour, TeamOne will display a prompt asking the user to sign in to either save or reset the board.
