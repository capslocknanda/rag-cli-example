# Devices page
The **Devices** page allows admins to perform the following tasks:
  

  * Add and remove devices to manage
  * Send commands to devices
  * Organize devices into groups
  * Review details for added devices
  * Export a list of all devices


  

These tasks can be performed remotely via the web interface. Additionally, you can send commands individually to each device, or by batch to a group of devices.
  

  

## Add devices
On first launch, the Devices page will not have any device listed and shows the following tutorial page.
  

  

  

You will need to add devices manually. To perform this task, follow the steps in the article below: 
  

  * [Add devices to Manager](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/1577705)


  

  

## Send commands
Once you have devices added, use the side panel to send commands to one or more devices. To view the full list of commands, refer to the article below:
  

  * [Send commands to devices](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/1598393)


  

  

For devices assigned with an **Advanced license** : Use Jobs to apply commands with specific pre-defined parameters to devices. These commands can be sent to take effect immediately, or set to run on a schedule. A job can be applied to multiple devices, or groups of devices. To assign jobs, see the guide below:
  

  * [Create, assign and schedule Jobs](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/1192470#assign-job-from-device-list-4)


  

  

## Sort into groups
Organize devices into groups to apply tasks to multiple devices at once. Supported tasks include sending commands, assigning profiles, scheduling jobs, etc. Note that while actions are applied to all devices within a group, specific actions will only take effect if the target device supports it. 
  

For more details on creating a group and adding devices into groups, see the guide below:
  * [Sort devices into groups](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/1561802)


  

  

  

## Review device details

  1. Locate the device you want to review.
  2. Click on the row of your target device. Leave the checkbox unselected.   
A new side panel should appear.
