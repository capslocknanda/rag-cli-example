# Account migration FAQs
To improve your experience and simplify access across all ViewSonic services, we’re moving from the current myViewBoard account system to the new ViewSonic Account platform. This upgrade brings a unified login for tools like myViewBoard, Manager, ClassSwift, and TeamOne—making it easier to manage your account, roles, and subscriptions in one place.
  

You don’t need to create a new account—your existing login and data will carry over automatically. While the transition will introduce some changes in how you access and manage certain features, we’re here to guide you every step of the way.
  

## Account migration FAQs
The FAQ below will help answer the most common questions and ensure you’re ready for the change.
  

  

Why is myViewBoard switching to the ViewSonic Account system?
This migration is part of a broader strategy to centralize account management under the ViewSonic brand. It will unify authentication across services such as ClassSwift, TeamOne, and myViewBoard, making it easier for users to manage their digital ecosystem. By aligning all platforms under a single identity provider, we are enhancing data security, streamlining permission handling, and improving long-term scalability across enterprise and educational environments.
  

Do I need to create a new ViewSonic account?
No. Your current myViewBoard account will be automatically migrated. You will use the same login credentials, but access will now route through the new ViewSonic sign-in interface. The transition is seamless, and you won’t lose your data, subscriptions, or roles in the process.
  

What changes will I notice after the migration?
You’ll see several visual and structural changes across the login and account management experience. These include:
  

  * A new sign-in page with ViewSonic branding and layout
  * A centralized avatar section for account-level settings
  * Entity management now handled through the ViewSonic Entity portal
  * Role management moved to product-specific portals


  

For a full breakdown with screenshots, please refer to the User Manual.
  

Will this affect how I manage my organization (Entity)?
Yes. Entity management tasks—such as managing users, subscriptions, or domain settings—will now take place in the ViewSonic Entity portal. Admins must assign roles individually within each ViewSonic service (e.g., myViewBoard, Manager, etc), as these permissions are no longer linked together.
  

While this adds more flexibility and clearer separation of access, it also means administrators will need to dedicate more time to managing permissions across platforms.
  

See our Entity Management Guide for detailed steps.
  

What should IT Admins do before the migration?
To ensure a smooth experience, please whitelist the following domains and addresses within your firewall and email systems:
  

  * viewsonic.com
  * cloud.viewsonic.com
  * no-reply@service.viewsonic.cloud


  

Whitelisting these ensures that users receive all important emails (e.g., verification, password resets) and that UI components function properly without being blocked by network restrictions.
  

Will there be any impact on login or user access?
No impact on credentials or account access is expected—users will continue using their existing login details. However, because of the new layout and updated sign-in screen, some users may initially be confused or unsure if they are in the right place. We will provide clear UI comparisons and tooltips to guide them through the new experience.
  

What if I am an old user/entity—what happens to my roles and permissions after the migration? Will anything change?
Your current roles and access will stay exactly the same after the migration—this includes Admins, Owners, and Users within both myViewBoard and Manager. However, going forward, any changes to roles or new permissions must be handled separately within each platform. Role synchronization across apps will no longer occur.
  

Breakdown:
  * **myViewBoard:** You can still manage user access from the myViewBoard portal as usual.
  * **Manager:** Manager will now manage its own Admins independently. While the user list is pulled from the ViewSonic Account, Manager does not inherit roles from either myViewBoard or ViewSonic—Admins must be assigned manually inside Manager.
  * **ViewSonic Account Dashboard:** This is now the source of truth for your organization’s user list and high-level access. However, it only supports basic roles like Owner or Admin, and doesn't control granular app-level permissions.


  

Key Implications:
  * You keep your current access.
  * To assign or modify roles, visit the individual portals (e.g., myViewBoard for whiteboarding, Manager for device control).
  * New entities will only give initial Manager access to the Owner. Additional users must be added inside Manager.


  

This shift enables more tailored access control across ViewSonic services but introduces a need for Admins to adapt to multi-platform role management.
  

What if I am a new user/entity?
When a new ViewSonic Entity Account is created, the Entity Owner and Admin are automatically assigned the same roles in myViewBoard, with full access. If they wish to add more myViewBoard admins later, they can do so via myViewBoard settings. These additional admins will not have admin rights in the ViewSonic Account — their access is limited to myViewBoard only.
  

What happens to my current subscriptions and settings?
All your active subscriptions, whether individual or tied to an entity, will be seamlessly migrated to the ViewSonic Account system. You’ll manage them from the ViewSonic dashboard moving forward. Settings tied to specific apps—like cloud integrations, bookmarks, or linked drives—will remain inside myViewBoard and continue to work as expected.
  

Where can I manage users and assign roles after the migration?
Use the ViewSonic Entity portal to manage the general user list and assign top-level roles like Owner and Admin. To assign app-specific permissions (e.g., who can access Manager, Insights, or act as a whiteboard Admin), you will need to use each product’s built-in management dashboard. Think of the ViewSonic Account as the gateway to delegate general access, while deeper control stays within the apps themselves.
  

Where can I get help during or after the migration?
We’ve prepared multiple support channels to ensure a smooth transition:
  * Knowledge Base: Up-to-date articles and tutorials
  * Video walkthroughs to help visualize UI changes
  * In-app notifications and banners for real-time reminders
  * myViewBoard Knowledgebase for technical issues or personalized assistance

  

What manual action do I have to do to make it work?
The only action IT admins require to do is to whitelist two domains:
  

  * service.viewsonic.cloud
  * billing.viewsonic.cloud


  

This will ensure you will receive emails on time.
