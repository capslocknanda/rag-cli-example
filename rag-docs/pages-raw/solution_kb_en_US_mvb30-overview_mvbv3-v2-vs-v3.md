## New features
We've highlighted a few major features introduced and improved in the new myViewBoard version.
  

### File management
  

  

## Multi-tabs
## Export Preview
This release add tabs that enable teachers to open and switch between multiple .OLF format lessons in one session. The new multi-tab interface supports:
  

  * Seamless switching between files.
  * Cross-file copy-paste functionality.
  * Magic Box offers enhanced usability to categorize tools with descriptive labels.
  * Simplified navigation improves onboarding, especially for educators. 


This feature integrates with cloud storage, supports QR code sharing, and allows students to quickly access, review, and save teaching materials.
  

  

### New canvas features
**  
**
## Irlen Filter
## Long Press
  

We've included an Irlen Filter section to the background menu. The Irlen Filter feature adds scientifically-backed background color options that are designed to support learners with diverse visual processing needs.
Performing a 'Long Press' (or right-click in laptop mode) displays long-press actions. This allows teachers to access their preferred tools without disrupting lesson flow. The shortcut includes a set of default actions, with the option to add eight more.
  

  

### Feature enhancements
  

  * **Navigation Map**  
The Navigation Map allows users to quickly jump across different sections of a canvas, enabling faster navigation during instruction.  
  

  * **Tooltips / Shortcuts**  
This enhancement provides hints for commonly used tools on Android and macOS versions, and aims to help users operate myViewBoard more efficiently.


  

  

  

### Cross-platform feature alignment
  

## Magic Box Tools
## Participate Mode
## AI Pen Tools
  

This version marks a step toward aligning tool behavior and availability across platforms, with Android and iOS now more closely matching the Windows experience. Aligned features now include: 
  

  * Flash cards 
  * Combined shapes 
  * Speech-to-text 
  * and more to come!


  

  

This version enhances collaboration sessions with richer background options for interactive learning:
  

  * Toggle between full-screen and canvas mode. 
  * Pop-up windows for individualized grading and progress tracking.


  

We've improved the AI Pen's capabilities for shape recognition and image quick-search/insertion.
