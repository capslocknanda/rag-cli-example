# **Easy Screen Casting and Sharing  
ViewSonic® AirSync™ Software**
This wireless casting software allows you to wirelessly mirror your screen from any device to one or multiple larger displays using our secure app or your web browser. AirSync also supports built-in casting like Miracast, Airplay, and Google Cast, making it easy to share content quickly and securely.
Schedule Demo
## **Flexible Touchback Casting**
**With touchback control, you can cast lessons from your ViewSonic display directly to your tablet or laptop** , allowing you to walk around the classroom and engage with students individually. With support for casting from up to 10 devices, you can effortlessly control what is shown at the front of the classroom from wherever you are.
## **Secure Moderator Mode**
You can maintain complete control by approving up to six students from a virtual waiting room. **You have authority over what is shown on the main screen** , ensuring that all attention remains on the lesson rather than on distractions.
## **Split Screen**
**Keep the entire class on the same page by bringing up multiple devices side-by-side—laptops, tablets, or phones—in a single view on the main display.** This is perfect for comparing documents, reviewing student work, or running collaborative exercises.
## **Dynamic Casting**
**Effortlessly cast your mobile device or laptop PC screen to a large display using local network or internet casting.** This dual-casting capability ensures seamless lessons and presentations, whether you’re in the same room or connecting remotely, offering unparalleled convenience and versatility.
## **Unified Multi-screen Viewing**
**Display classroom content on up to 10 networked screens, providing clear views for all students even in larger rooms.** Additionally, you can seamlessly transmit content from the main display to other screens and devices in various classroom zones. This empowers teachers to lead lessons in media centers or smaller groups while maintaining focus and alignment with the core lesson content across all learning spaces.
## **Universal Compatibility**
Students can take the stage using any compatible device they bring to class, whether it’s a MacBook, iPad, Windows laptop, or Android tablet. **With built-in support for AirPlay, Miracast, and Google Cast, participation is encouraged from every corner of the room.**
