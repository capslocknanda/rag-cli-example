# Share IFP to device
AirSync also allows users to view the contents of the IFP to their devices. This allows them to review the contents up close and may help them better understand details that may not be obvious when viewing the screen from a distance.
  

## Send IFP screen to device
To view the contents of the IFP screen on a user device, you will need to configure AirSync on the IFP board first. 
  

  

_On the IFP:_
  1. Open the AirSync app. 
  2. Click **Settings** on the bottom left.
  3. Navigate to the following section:
     * **Broadcast » Cast to devices**  
  

  4. Enable the **Cast to devices** toggle.   
The **Cast to device** icon appears on the side.   
  

  5. Tap the **Cast to device** icon to switch to the **Receive from screen** page. Note the following details: 
    1. Display code 
    2. One-time password  
  

  6. Leave the app running, then head over to your device.


  

  

  

  

_On the target device:_
  1. Open the AirSync Sender app.
  2. Fill in the details provided by the IFP:
    1. Display code
    2. One-time password  
  

  
  
  

  3. Click **Next**.
  4. On the next screen, click **Receive**. 
    1. Type a unique name to identify this device on the **Device list**.
    2. Click **Next**.  
  

  5. The device should start showing the contents of the IFP on the device's screen.
  6. To exit, click   
  



  

  

Note the following behavior:
  * You can share the IFP screen to a max of 10 devices running AirSync Sender.
  * All versions of AirSync Sender except Web Sender can receive the IFP screen.


  

  

## Enable touchback
Everyone connected will see the contents of the IFP on their screen. By default, participants can only view the screen. To allow interaction with the IFP, enable **Touchback** for the connected device.
  

_On the IFP:_
  1. Perform the steps listed above, then wait for the target device to connect.  
Once connected, the target device should appear on the **Device list** using the name provided during the connection setup.   
  

  2. Tap the **Touchback button** beside the entry for the target device.   
All touch data (or mouse clicks) over the AirSync Sender client are now forwarded to the IFP. Note the following behavior:
     * The user can only interact with UI elements inside the ViewBoard OS.
     * The host can enable touchback for multiple devices.
     * The host maintains full software and hardware control over the IFP.  
  

  3. Tap the **Disable** icon to stop the user from interacting. The user loses control over the IFP but can still view the IFP screen on their device.
  4. Tap the **Touchback** button again to re-enable control for the last user, or grant control to another user.
  5. Tap the **Remove** icon to disconnect a device and clear up an entry on the **Device list**. This also stops the disconnected user from viewing the IFP screen.


  

  

## Touchback off
## Touchback on
  

  

  

  

Note that the touchback option can only be enabled for devices that connect with the AirSync Sender app. Devices that use the AirSync Web Sender to connect will not have the touchback option available.
