# CAP Messaging
Manager supports **Outbound CAP** (Common Alerting Protocol) Endpoint integration with 3rd party API. Manager can receive messages from supported CAP platforms and forward them to selected devices.
  

Manager supports the following CAP messaging systems:
  * InformaCast
  * CrisisGo
  * Alertus


  

  

## Create CAP URL
To generate required details for a new CAP URL, perform the following steps:
  

  1. Navigate to the top bar of the Manager console. 
  2. Click the _‍_**Settings** button.
  3. Click the **CAP Messaging** button to open the **CAP Messaging** popup.  
  

  4. Click **Add new** to create a new CAP URL. Provide the following details.
    1. For **CAP Name** , specify a unique name to identify this URL. 
    2. For **Device Groups** , select a group that will receive the CAP messages. 
    3. Click **Confirm**.  
  

  5. On the new **Created CAP URL** window:   
Click **Copy** then paste the CAP details in a safe location.   
  
◦ **CAP URL**  
◦ **Username**  
◦ **Password**  
  
The password won't be shown again after you close the window.  
Click **Copy** and paste this password in a safe location.   
  
  

  6. Click **Confirm** to close the window. 


  

  

## Create URL
## CAP URL details
  

  

Input the **CAP URL** , **Username** , and **Password** details into your broadcasting system's console to complete the connection between Manager and your broadcasting system. Once connection has been established, Manager's CAP Messaging feature sends broadcasts from your broadcasting system to all devices in your specified group.
  

  

## Device groups
The CAP Messaging feature can only send to groups. To send CAP messages to specific devices, create a group for these devices. Note that a CAP URL can only target one group.
  

To include a new device to an existing CAP Messaging configuration, simply add the device to that configuration's target group.
  

  

## Manage CAP URLs
To manage CAP URL entries, perform the following steps:
  

  1. Navigate to the top bar of the Manager console. 
  2. Click the _‍_**Settings** button.
  3. Click the **CAP Messaging** button to open the **CAP Messaging** popup.  
  

  4. On the popup, locate the name of the CAP URL to review.
  5. Note the following icons:   
  
  
  
*  
  
* Once deleted, devices won't get broadcasts from systems using this URL.   
  
  

  6. Click **Close** to dismiss the window.
