# Share IFP to IFP
You can share your IFP screen to other IFPs running AirSync on the same network. To enable this feature, perform the following:
  

  1. On the source IFP, tap the **Settings** icon.
  2. Go to **Settings » Broadcast » Cast to boards**.
  3. Turn on the **Broadcast to the display group** feature.


  

  

## Broadcasting options
Users have two options when the screen broadcast function becomes active: 
  

#### **Only when casting**
The screen broadcast function is automatically started only when the source IFP is receiving a screen. The source IFP forwards whatever is being shared to the display group. In turn, all IFPs in the display group mirror whatever is being displayed on the source IFP. When the sharing stops, the broadcast also stops.
  

To enable screen broadcast when casting: 
  1. On the source IFP, tap the **Settings** icon.
  2. Go to **Settings » Broadcast » Cast to boards**.
  3. Turn on the **Broadcast to the display group** feature.
  4. Select **Only when casting**.
  5. Select up to 10 IFPs in the **Display group**.
  6. Tap **Save**.


  

#### **Always**
The screen broadcast function automatically starts displaying the real-time live contents of the target IFP to the display group. In turn, all IFPs in the display group mirror whatever is being displayed on the source IFP.
  

To start the screen broadcast: 
  1. On the source IFP, tap the **Settings** icon.
  2. Go to **Settings » Broadcast » Cast to boards**.
  3. Turn on the **Broadcast****to the display group** feature.
  4. Select **All the time**.
  5. Select up to 10 IFPs in the **Display group**.
  6. Tap **Broadcast**.


  

To stop the screen broadcast: 
  1. On the source IFP, tap the **Settings** icon.
  2. Go to **Settings » Broadcast » Cast to boards**.
  3. Turn off the **Broadcast****to the display group** feature.
  4. Tap **Save**.


  

You can also perform these steps on the target IFPs (in the display group) to instantly stop receiving the broadcast.
  

  

  

## Display group
The **Display group** is a list of all IFPs auto-detected inside the network that can receive the broadcast. You can select a maximum of 10 IFPs from this list.
  

**Important**
Be mindful of which IFPs are selected in the **Display group**. Starting a broadcast will immediately cancel any sharing session hosted on the target IFP. While this feature may be useful for emergencies, this may cause some inconvenience for affected users.
  

  

  

  

By default, all broadcast requests received by IFPs in the display group must be manually granted permission before it even displays the content. To modify this behavior, perform the following:
  

  1. On the source IFP, tap the **Settings** icon.
  2. Go to **Settings » Device settings**.  
  

  3. Tap the **If invited to a display group** dropdown.  
Select one of the following:
     * **Notify me**. Display the broadcast only after granting permission.
     * **Auto Accept**. Display the broadcast automatically, no prompts.
     * **Ignore**. Ignore all broadcast requests.  
  

  4. All changes are saved immediately.


  

  

  

## Troubleshooting
If a specific IFP does not appear in the **Display group** , possible reasons include:
  * The target IFP is not on the same network as the sending end.
  * The sending end is still searching for the target IFP. Depending on the actual network equipment and environment, some devices may take one to two minutes to appear in the list.

  
  

If the IFP is not receiving the broadcast. This may happen if:
  * The receiving end is not on the same network as the sending end.
  * The receiving end is configured to never accept screen broadcasts.
  * The receiving end manually rejected the screen broadcast.
  * The receiving end does not have AirSync as the actively running app on the IFP. The AirSync app must be on the foreground to receive a broadcast.
