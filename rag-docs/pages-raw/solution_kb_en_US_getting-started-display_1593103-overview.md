# Display Overview
myViewBoard **Display** enables users to mirror their desktop wirelessly to supported Interactive Flat Panels (IFPs) and Wireless Presentation Displays (WPDs). Casting is initiated from a web browser and received by the Display app running on the IFP/WPD.
  

  

## Availability
The myViewBoard Display app turns any device into a wireless receiver that can mirror another device’s screen by providing a **Display Code** + **One-time password**. Display is available on the following platforms:
  

  * Preinstalled on selected **ViewBoard** hardware.
  * Install on any IFP or WPD that runs:
    * **Android 6.0** or higher (Display for Android)
    * **Windows** (Display for Windows)


  

  

## Receiving device
## Web based sender
  

**_Receiving device_** : Display app landing screen on a ViewSonic ViewBoard as a receiving device.
● ● ●
  

**_Casting device_** : For devices that will share their screens, launch a browser to access the Display webpage.
  

When installed on Interactive Flat Panels (IFPs), these IFPs can serve as the perfect receiving display. Users can launch a supported web browser on any PC or Mac laptop/desktop with an internet connection to share their screen—no wires required.
  

Web browsers in mobile and tablet devices are not supported as casting sources.
