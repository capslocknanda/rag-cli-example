# Cast from AirSync Sender
Use the AirSync Sender to share your screen to the IFP.
  

  

## Use AirSync Sender
To share via AirSync Sender, perform the following steps:
  

  

_On the target IFP:_
  

  1. Open the AirSync app. 
  2. Note the following details: 
     * Display code 
     * One-time password  
  

  3. Leave the app running, then head over to your device.


  

  

  

  

_On the target device:_
  

  1. Launch AirSync Sender.
  2. Fill in the details provided by the IFP:
     * Display code
     * One-time password  
  

  

  3. Click **Next**.
  4. On the next page, click **Share**.   
  

  

  5. On the dialog that appears, select the resource you want to share to the IFP: 
     * **Entire screen**. Share the contents of your main display in full-screen. For multi-monitor setups, specify which display to share. 
     * **Window**. Share the contents of one application currently running. The application window must not be minimized.
     * **Screen extension**. Creates a virtual screen that the OS treats as an extra monitor attached to the system. You can move windows and applications you want to share to this 'monitor'. Note that only the AirSync Sender for Windows and AirSync Sender for macOS independent version supports this feature.  
  
  
  
  
  

  6. Click **Share**.
  7. The IFP should now start showing the contents playing on the device's screen.


  

  

## Manage sharing
AirSync provides the following options to manage your sharing session:
  * **Pause**. Temporary freezes the screen sharing. Click again to resume sharing.
  * **Stop presenting**. Stops the sharing session and brings the user back to the connection screen.
  * **Touchback**. Forwards inputs made on the IFP to the target device. This allows a user to control their device using any input methods supported by the target IFP (touch, mice, pen, etc.).


  

  

  

  

## Additional details
Note the following behavior:
  

  * A sharing session can last up to three hours. Five minutes before the end of the three hours, a countdown will be displayed at the lower right of the screen. If needed, you can choose to extend twice which makes the total sharing duration up to nine hours. The session will automatically close after the third (final) countdown.   
  

  * Even when a sharing session has started, AirSync will still accept new mirror requests and will automatically go into split-screen view to show all screens. You can zoom in and out, or restore individual screens as needed. Depending on the IFP model, AirSync can accept up to 4 to 6 devices for simultaneous projection. For more details, see the following article:
