# Device requirements
Different versions of the AirSync Sender application are available so you can select a version that best fits your casting environment. For optimal performance in sending and receiving screens, verify that your devices meet the following requirements.
  

  

## IFP requirements
AirSync comes pre-installed with selected IFPs. To determine if your IFP supports AirSync, kindly refer to the list in the article below:
  * [AirSync ViewBoard support](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/en_US/troubleshooting/viewboard-support "AirSync ViewBoard support")


  

  

## Windows 
For optimal performance on Windows, install the AirSync Sender on devices that meet these requirements:
  * OS Version: 
    * Windows 10 build 1709 and above
    * Windows 11 (recommended)
  * CPU: Intel Core i3 or above, or AMD equivalent.
  * CPU Architecture: x64
  * Memory: 8 GB or more
  * LAN or WAN connection required


  

Download from the following site:
  

Note that virtual monitors or emulated displays may prevent some features from working correctly. If possible, disable these before launching the AirSync Sender application.
  

## Android
AirSync can run on both Android smartphones and tablets provided they meet the following requirements: 
  * Android 10 or above
  * Memory: Recommended 6 GB or more
  * LAN or WAN connection required


  

Download from the following site:
  

## iOS
iOS devices that plan to run the AirSync Sender must meet the following requirements:
  * iOS 12 or above
  * LAN or WAN connection required


  

Download from the following site:
  

## macOS
Ensure that the macOS device meets the following requirements:
  * macOS 10.14 or above
  * LAN or WAN connection required


  

Download from the following site:
  

  

### macOS client audio settings
To allow the AirSync Sender application to share both video and audio, users must install the macOS virtual audio driver before sharing their screen. 
  

  

## Supported drivers
You can use the default macOS virtual audio driver, or use one of the following virtual drivers:
  

  * VB-Audio: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
  * Blackhole: https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole
  * Loopback: https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/


  

  

## Installation steps 
The following steps use the Blackhole app as an example.
  

  1. Download the Blackhole macOS installation file (e.g. BlackHole2ch.v0.5.0.pkg).
  2. Close all running audio applications.
  3. Click on the installation file. 
  4. Follow the steps to complete the installation.
  5. Switch over to the AirSync Sender application and start using it to share your screen.


  

  

After the driver is installed, start a cast to prompt the macOS AirSync sender to detect the driver and automatically adjust the device's audio output settings. There is no need to configure it manually. Once the cast ends, the sender auto-reverts back to the previous audio output settings.
  

  

If there is no audio driver installed, the sender displays a notification message on the initial view and select screen view. You can still share your screen but without audio.
  

  

‍ 
### Wi-Fi dongle
We recommend using the following Wi-Fi dongle models to ensure optimal performance and compatibility with AirSync:
  * VB-WIFI-001
  * VB-WIFI-006
