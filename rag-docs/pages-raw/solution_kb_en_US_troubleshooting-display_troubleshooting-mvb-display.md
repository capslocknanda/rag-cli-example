# Troubleshooting Display
Since **Display** needs a stable internet connection to work, you might occasionally experience issues.
  

## Cannot share screen
If you are unable to share your screen, follow these initial steps:
  

  * **Check your network**   
Ensure both the sending and receiving devices have a stable internet connection.  
  

  * **Verify the One-Time Password**   
If the password has expired, type the new one.   
  

  * **Mirroring limits**  
Display for Windows and Android support **1:1 mirroring**. Each session must be between one device and one client only. Verify that no other device is sharing to your target Display app.


  

  

## WebRTC issues
Display uses the real-time communication (RTC) protocol **WebRTC** to share video. If you still can't connect, use the the following online tool to test your WebRTC status:
  

  

  

_On the receiving device_
Use a web browser to run the online tool for **W****ebRTC** status. If the results show:
  

  * At least 1 green line, WebRTC network has no connection issues.
  * Only red or yellow lines, WebRTC network is blocked or has an issue.


  

  

_On the casting device_
Use a web browser to run the online tool for **W****ebRTC** status. If the results show: 
  

  * At least 1 green line, WebRTC network has no connection issues.
  * Only red or yellow lines, WebRTC network is blocked and has an issue.


  

  

In summary: Both receiving and casting devices must display at least 1 green line to indicate a **healthy WebRTC connection**.
  

  

To resolve WebRTC connectivity issues, verify that all recommended ports are open and accessible. For more information, refer to the following article to review the system requirements for Display:

## Display Code is missing
Occasionally, a server error may prevent the **Display Code** or **One-Time Password** from appearing. If this occurs: 
  

  * Wait a few minutes, and then check the Display app again. 
  * Avoid using Display until the code and password have reappeared.
