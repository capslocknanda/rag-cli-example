# Send commands to devices
Once you have several devices added, you can now use the side panel to send commands to one or more devices.
  

## Access the side panel
Launch Manager and perform the following: 
  

  1. Click the 
  2. Click the 
  3. Click the **All Devices** tab. 
  4. On the device list, click the checkbox of the devices you want to manage.
  5. A side panel should appear on the right. 


  

This side panel includes all commands available for the license type applied to the selected devices. Each command has an icon that you can click to show more options.
  

**Important**
Review the commands carefully before sending them to the device. It is mandatory that Manager admins have a good understanding of how each command affects the target devices.
  

  

## List of commands
The table below provides an overview of all commands. Note that each command comes with its own set of options that admins have to configure before sending. Most actions immediately take effect, but some will require manual intervention from the user.
  

Icon | Commands to send  
---|---  
|  **Volume**  
Adjust the volume on selected devices.  
|  **Brightness**  
Adjust the backlight level on selected devices.  
|  **Power Off**  
Power off selected devices.  
|  **Restart**  
Restart selected devices.  
|  [**Standby Mode**](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/manager-advanced-features/standby-mode)** ***  
Specify how the device behaves if left idle for a set period of time.  
|  **Change Input Source**  
Change the input source of the selected devices. To edit the input source alias, use the _Change input source_ setting on the device.  
|  **Screen On/Off**  
Toggle to turn a _screen_ on or off. This does not turn the device off. Users can interact with the device to wake it up.  
|  **Screen Lock**  
Set if users can interact with the screen. If interaction is disabled, users will not be able to interact with the device until a Manager user enables it again.   
  
Note that the Screen lock within Manager is different from the embedded ScreenLock app on a device. 
  * Embedded Screen Lock app requires a password to unlock the screen.
  * Screen lock within Manager requires an IT Admin to unlock the screen.

  
|  **Add Wi-Fi SSID**  
Add a Wi-Fi SSID to selected devices.  
|  **Manage Wi-Fi Networks**  
Manage saved Wi-Fi networks on selected devices.  
|  **[Update Firmware](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/managing-devices/update-firmware)**  
Click this button to immediately trigger a firmware update.  
|  **Auto Firmware Update**  
Set selected devices to automatically update device firmware any time new firmware is available and the device is online. User can set a specific time for Manager to check for new firmware and update the device.  
|  **Allow installation of unknown apps**  
Toggle to allow installation of unknown apps on a device.  
|  **Settings Lock ***  
Specify if users can manually modify settings on the device.  
|  [**Startup Mode**](https://www.viewsonic.com/solution/kb/manager-advanced-features/startup-mode)** ***  
Specify the input source that activates when the device is turned on.  
|  **ViewBoard Cast Settings ***  
Configure settings related to casting on the selected devices.  
|  **Factory Reset**  
Reset the device settings back to factory defaults.  
  

  

Commands marked with an asterisk ( * ) are only available for devices that have an Advance license applied. If you need to obtain or apply an Advance license, refer to the article below:
