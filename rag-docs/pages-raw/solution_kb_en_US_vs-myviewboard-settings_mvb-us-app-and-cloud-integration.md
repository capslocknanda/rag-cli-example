# App & Cloud Integration
Use the **Apps & Cloud Services** page to connect to cloud services that will be available during your session when you sign in with your myViewBoard account. 
  

## Supported cloud services
The following cloud services are supported:
  

Icon | Service  
---|---  
| Google Drive  
| OneDrive  
| OneDrive for Business  
| SharePoint  
| Dropbox  
| Box  
| Nextcloud Files  
| Google Classroom  
  

  

## Link to cloud services
To enable access to specific Cloud Services, follow these steps:
  

  1. Sign in to 
  2. Locate the **myViewBoard** tile and launch your user settings.
  3. Click **App & Cloud Integration **section on the side panel.  
  

  4. On the table of supported services, perform the following:
     * On the **Status** column:   
Click the   
Do this for every service you want to connect to.  
  

     * On the **Default** column:   
Click the   
myViewBoard will connect to this default service to load custom images for backgrounds, line pens, and shape tool features.   
  

  5. Note that any changes to this page are automatically saved, but allow some time for the updates to take effect. 


  

You should be now able to connect with the service when you sign in with your account.
  

  

  

## Folder directory
The binding process will create a **myViewBoard** folder in the root directory of your cloud storage, then adds several sub-folders inside. These new sub-folders are required by specific myViewBoard features to function properly. 
  

  

This folder | Contains  
---|---  
Background | Images for your custom **Backgrounds**  
Magic Line Pen | Images for the **Magic Line Pen**  
Shape Pen | Images for the **Shape Pen**  
Media | Default folder for the cloud feature of the **Magic Box**. myViewBoard does not auto-save files here but it is recommended to keep frequently used media in this location for easier access.  
Pop Quiz | All saved questions from your **Pop Quiz** sessions  
Throw | Files received from the **Throw** feature  
QR Share | PDF files generated when sharing materials via **QR code**  
  

  

Once a cloud service is connected, you can:
  * Save custom images for backgrounds, shape pens, and magic line pens.
  * Load and import supported file types, including OLF, PPT, and PDF files stored in cloud drives.


  

  

## Default image settings
Default images are custom images that myViewBoard automatically loads when you sign in. These can be used to personalize your workspace with predefined visual elements.
  

You can configure default images for the following tools:
  

  * Backgrounds
  * Shape pens
  * Magic line pens


  

Default image support is limited to cloud services marked with a star (★). When default images are set:
  

  * myViewBoard searches for them in the cloud service you have marked as default.
  * If found, these images are loaded automatically during sign-in.
  * If no cloud service is set as default, myViewBoard uses its standard images instead.


  

  

## NextCloud integration
myViewBoard supports integration with Nextcloud, a private, self-hosted cloud storage system. You can link Nextcloud to myViewBoard using one of the following:
  * Login credentials 
  * App password


  

### Use login credentials
This method integrates NextCloud by simply using your login credentials.
  

  1. Log into myViewBoard, and go to:   
  
**myViewBoard Settings****App & Cloud Integration**  
  

  2. Click the link icon beside the **Nextcloud** entry. 
  3. Provide your NextCloud credentials:
     * **Server address** : Type the URL or IP of your Nextcloud server.
     * **Username** : Enter your Nextcloud username.
     * **Password** : Enter your Nextcloud password.  
  

  4. Click **OK** to confirm.   
myViewBoard will check your details and confirm the connection.


  

  

For guidance on determining the correct server address, see the following guide:
  

  

### Use a app password
For added security, Nextcloud also offers a method to generate an app password. This method allows users to assign a unique password to specific apps.
  

  1. Sign in to your Nextcloud server.
  2. Go to the following page:  
  
**Settings****Security****Devices & sessions***  
  

  3. Click **Create a new app password**.
  4. Copy this new app password. 


  

* **Important**
Note that the location of the **Devices & sessions** page vary depending on the version of Nextcloud you have installed. If this page is missing, refer to the Nextcloud documentation for more details.
  

  

  

  

Once you have copied the password, go back to the myViewBoard site:
  

  1. Log into myViewBoard, and go to:   
  
**myViewBoard Settings****App & Cloud Integration**  
  

  2. Click the link icon beside the **Nextcloud** entry. 
  3. Provide your NextCloud credentials:
     * **Server address** : Type the URL or IP of your Nextcloud server.
     * **Username** : Type your Nextcloud username.
     * **Password** : Paste the new Nextcloud app password.  
  

  4. Click **OK** to confirm.   
myViewBoard will check your details and confirm the connection.


  

After setup, your Nextcloud files will be available in myViewBoard. Make sure to keep your credentials or password current to avoid connection issues.
