# Split screen
  
When two or more people share their screen at the same time, AirSync switches to split-screen mode, and arranges the shared screens into number of panels. Note the following features:
  * Up to 9 participants can share their screens.
  * Runs on both Internet and local connections.
  * Also works when sharing via AirPlay / Google Cast / Miracast.


  

  

## Auto-enable split screen
To automatically enable the split-screen feature in a multi-user sharing scenario, perform the following:
  

  1. During screen sharing, on the lower left corner: 
     * Tap **More** to display all options, then
     * Tap **Add screen** on the far right.  
  

  2. On the **Share your screens** popup, new presenters share their screens by: 
     * Using the display code and one-time password, or 
     * Scanning the QR code  
  

  3. Once the new sharing requests connect, the IFP automatically splits the view to show all screens.


  

  

## Display Code
## QR Code
  

  

## Screen controls
Individual screen controls are available for each split panel: 
  * **Mute**. Disables the sound from the selected panel
  * **Expand**. Switches the selected panel to full screen 
  * **Disconnect**. Removes the panel from the sharing session.


  

  

## 4-panel split
## 6-panel split
  

  

  

  

## 6-panel split compatibility
Devices that support 6-panel split include:
  

  * IFP50-5 
  * IFP52-1
  * IFP52-2
  * IFP9850-4


  

The 6-panel split will be available in version 3.6.11.
## 9-panel split compatibility
Devices that support 9-panel split include:
  

  * IFP/CDE92
  * IFP/CDE105
  * IFP110
  * IFP51
  * IFP53


  

Note that the list will be updated as support for more devices are added. For other supported devices, AirSync will switch to 4-panel split when presenting multiple screens.
