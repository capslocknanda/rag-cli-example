# Sort devices into groups
Organize devices into groups to send custom commands to multiple devices at once. Note that the action will only take effect if the target device supports it. 
  

## Create a group
Create a group that will be used to organize your devices. It is highly recommended to create groupings based on a logical feature, like location (office group, balcony group, etc.), department (Accounting, Marketing, etc.), or model (CDE, IFP50, etc.) so it will be easier to identify the devices you want to target later. 
  

  1. Click the 
  2. Click the 
  3. Click the **All Devices** tab.
  4. Click the **Groups**  
  

  5. Click **Create Group** at the bottom of the dropdown.
    1. Type a unique name for your group.
    2. Click **OK**.  
  

  6. The new group is added to the list inside the dropdown. 


  

  

Once you have some top-level groups, you can further organize by adding sub-groups:
  

  1. Click the **Groups**
  2. Click the   
  

  3. Click **Create Group** inside that directory.
    1. Type a unique name for your group.
    2. Click **OK**.  
  

  4. The new group is added to the list inside the dropdown. 


  

  

Click 
┗ |  **Create****subgroup**   
Create a new subgroup under this group. Note that all actions applied to the parent group will also apply to the subgroups.  
---|---  
┗ |  **Rename**   
Change the name of the group. The new name must not be similar to an already existing name.  
┗ |  **Delete**   
Remove the group. This action does not remove the devices inside the group.  
  

  

Note the following behavior:
  * Click 
  * Groups with no sub-groups added will show a 0 on the far-right side.


  

  

## Add devices to a group
You can start adding devices once you have your groups ready. To add devices, perform the following:
  

  1. Click the 
  2. Click the 
  3. Click the **All Devices** tab.
  4. On the list below, click the checkbox of the devices you want to add to a group.  
  

  5. Click the **Add to** icon to open the **Add to Group** dialog.
    1. Select the groups where you want to add the selected devices.
    2. Click the 
    3. Click the breadcrumbs to go back to a previous group.
    4. Click **Add** once all desired groups have been selected.  
  

  6. The devices are added to the group.


  

  

Note the following behavior of the the **Add to Group** dialog:
  * Click 
  * Click **Create****subgroup** to create a new subgroup inside the current group.
  * The value of the **Selected** label indicates how many groups you have already selected, regardless of location. To reset the number and start over, click **Cancel**.
  * The number of sub-groups are displayed beside the 


  

  

  

## Send actions to a group
Once you have devices inside your groups, you can now use the group feature to only show all devices that are members of the group. 
  

  1. Click the 
  2. Click the 
  3. Click the **All Devices** tab.  
Note that Manager shows all devices on the Device List by default.  
  

  4. Click the **Groups**
    1. Click the 
    2. The Device List should update to show only the devices that are members of that group. Note that you can only select one group at a time.
    3. Click outside the dropdown to go back to the Device List.  
  

  5. Click the   
A side panel appears that shows all available actions.
  6. Finally, select actions that you would like to send to the target devices.
  7. To reset the view, click **Groups** dropdown.
