# Install and launch ClassSwift
Download, install, and launch ClassSwift on your device in just a few simple steps. Follow this guide to begin using the app right away. 
  

## Install ClassSwift 
Before you begin, make sure you have completed your setup in the 
  

### Step 1. Download the Installer 
You have two options to download ClassSwift: 
  * ClassSwift App only
    * Download the standalone ClassSwift App 
    * This option is suitable if you already have myViewBoard v3 installed on your device. 
  * Bundled Installer (myViewBoard v3 + ClassSwift)
    * Download the bundled installer 
    * The system will automatically detect what you already have:
      * If myViewBoard v3 is installed → it will install ClassSwift only. 
      * If neither app is installed → it will install both myViewBoard v3 and ClassSwift. 


  

### Step 2. Locate the Installer 
Open your Downloads folder and locate either: 
  * ClassSwiftInstaller-en.exe (standalone), or 
  * myViewBoard and ClassSwift.msi (bundled). 


  

### Step 3. Run the Installer 
  1. Double-click the file to start the installation. 
  2. Follow the on-screen instructions. 


  

### Step 4. Complete Setup 
  * Once the installation completes, ClassSwift will be ready to use on your device. 


  

  

## Launch ClassSwift 
You can open ClassSwift in two ways: 
  * From your desktop: Double-click the ClassSwift shortcut to launch directly. 
  * From myViewBoard V3: On a Windows slot-in PC connected to a ViewBoard interactive display:
    1. Open myViewBoard.
    2. Long-press (on the IFP) or right-click (on Windows computer) an empty area of the canvas to open the Magic Box. 
    3. Select the ClassSwift icon to launch. 


Notes: If ClassSwift has not been installed on the device before, selecting the ClassSwift icon will first trigger the installation process.
