# Page management
myViewBoard provides several ways to add, remove, rearrange, and manage your canvas to keep your lessons organized.
  

## Page management
Familiarizing yourself with how myViewBoard opens, presents, and displays files will help you greatly in planning your lessons.
  

  * **Files**   
myViewBoard uses the `.OLF` format to save and open files, but it also supports other popular file formats as well. 


  

  * **Pages**   
Each file can have multiple pages. Use the floating toolbar to manage your pages:


  

    * Click 
    * Click 
    * Click  1/1 to manage pages:
      * Drag a page to rearrange. 
      * Click 
      * Click ◯ to apply actions to multiple pages


  

  * **Tabs**   
Opening another file loads that file in a new tab. Use tabs to keep your lessons organized. 


  

  

## Custom backgrounds 
Spice up your lessons with different background colors and images.
  

  * **Background colors**   
myViewBoard provides several colors that you can use as background colors for your canvas, with the option to display two colors as a gradients.  
  

  * **Irlen Filters**  
The Irlen Filter feature adds scientifically-backed background color options that are designed to support learners with diverse visual processing needs.  
  

  * **Background images**  
myViewBoard also provides the option to add your own background images, either from your local drive or from a cloud service.


  

  

## Page tools
myViewBoard provides several tools that make working on the canvas easier and efficient.
  

  * **Grid**   
Overlays a grid on the canvas that you can use to align items.  
  

  * **Date**   
Displays the date and time on the upper right of the canvas. This comes in handy when recording your teaching sessions so you can easily remember when a session took place.  
  

  * **Zoom & Navigation**   
Use to navigate across the canvas, either by jumping to far areas or by zooming in and out.
