# Entity vs Individual Account
ClassSwift offers two types of accounts tailored to different user needs and teaching environments:
  

**Entity Account**
  * **Designed for:** Districts & Schools.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
    * Managed through a centralized admin panel on ClassSwift Hub
    * Supports integration with rostering systems like ClassLink/Clever
    * Enables bulk import of teacher
    * Provides organization-wide analytics and usage reports
  * **User Roles within Entity Account:**
    * **Admin/Owner:** Sets up the organization, manages rosters, and monitors usage through ClassSwift Hub.
    * **Teacher:** Assigned to pre-rostered classes; conducts session using ClassSwift App.
    * **Student:** Joins classes through accounts provisioned by the entity.


**Individual Account**
  * **Designed for:** Independent educators, tutors, or trial users managing their own classroom setup.
  * **Key Characteristics:**
    * Self-service sign-up
    * Ideal for personal use
    * Act as both admin and teacher simultaneously, using the same tools and functionality available to entity users
  * **User Roles within Individual Account:**
    * **Teacher:** Acts as the sole admin of their own account. Teachers can roster students manually before class or share a Quick Join link (or QR code) to let students join instantly without prior setup.
    * **Student:** Joins classes using the link or QR code shared by the teacher. No pre-rostered account is required.
